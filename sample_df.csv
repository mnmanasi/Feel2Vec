​finale,rap,ericdoa,2021,13208,{​ericdoa},"[Intro: dante red & ericdoa]
I watched you grow as a person
I saw every move that you did
Every accolade, every achievement, I was there for
You think I don’t know that?
I know you were, it’s just- it's not in my control anymore
I can't, I can't control it
So what are you gonna do, abandon everything you started with?
No, no, that’s not my intention at all, I'm not abandoning anything
You saw what life was like before any of this
I need to eat, I need to do things
And if that means I can't, you know, do the things that I did with you before then-
It sucks, but that's just the way things have to go
I get it, fuck you dude
Bro, come on, don't
Alright

[Chorus: dante red & ericdoa]
Jigs up, I don't wanna fight but put your fists up
Bitcrushed, signed a piece of paper, now you switchеd up
I blew you up, if it wasn't for my song, you wouldn't see the bucks
Beat him up, know I can't gеt betrayed, you can't be with us
Oh, it's like that?
Paint me as a monster, guess it's my bad
Sidetracked, I gotta let you go to get my mind back
Fuck you, everybody knows that I loved you
So did I, I'm the only one that understand your mind
[Verse 1: dante red & ericdoa]
Try to take me out, then that's a bad move (Huh)
Just like everyone I knew that you would act new (Huh)
Man, why come at me? I never would attack you
Separation, that's the only thing that cash do
To be honest, don't wanna end tonight
You're supposed to be a friend of mine
I would never end up switching sides
If I kill you, then it's suicide
So how you gonna do it right?
I was there for ""do or die""
I just wanna see you shine
And now I'm gettin' left behind
If it's the end of you, then it's the end of me
Don't want my only friend to be my enemy
I try my hardest to protect you
But if I wanna be an artist, gotta dead you
Oh, okay
What you mean that we can't do it together?
When I'm with you, I swear things always better
I'm glad you think that it's better
But in my mind think it's worse
People think that I'm you
And that comparison hurts
It's not what I deserve
Then what do you want?
It's better than an artist fuckin' putting you on
You did this all by yourself
You didn't need any help
[Chorus: dante red & ericdoa]
Jigs up, I don't wanna fight but put your fists up
Bitcrushed, signed a piece of paper, now you switched up
I blew you up, if it wasn't for my song, you wouldn't see the bucks
Beat him up, know I can't get betrayed, you can't be with us
Oh, it's like that?
Paint me as a monster, guess it's my bad
Sidetracked, I gotta let you go to get my mind back
Fuck you, everybody knows that I loved you
So did I, I'm the only one that understand your mind

[Verse 2: dante red & ericdoa]
No matter what happens just know, I'm still here
On the angels around me, you'll have a good year
And the same to you
If it was up to me, then I would change the rules
Man, just forget about that, focus on your bag
Ayy, history repeat itself, just know I'm coming back
Ha, I guess that's facts
You can meet me at the dropoff for one last laugh
(Hahaha, you're funny)",6636486,en,en,en
Waste,rock,Naevus,2002,10,{},"[Verse 1]
Long will be the passing day
Strong will be the urge to stay
Resigned to slump beneath the need
Designed to incubate the seed
Bend beneath
The weight, the grief
And so control
Your goal
See in objects’ static lines
The moving plan that they refine
Read into a body’s needs
The intention to deceive
The lid you lift
Will set you adrift
Because your skin
Is thin

[Verse 2]
The senses by themselves feel strange
And through them you hope to arrange
Actions into present facts
Activities into real lacks
Look: they show
The empty flow
That runs through
The things you do
You could be wrong and in which case
You should resolve to now displace
Effluvium, the rind of dreams
To flush it out in uric streams
Smell the waste
Without distaste
It will reveal
What you really feel",5955393,en,en,en

They wanna know what Floss 'bout?
Lyrically I'll leave you chalked out
Bossed out, got the goomar that's straight from Moscow
Lifestyle, took a lot to live it, we the illest
We push it to the limit, the profile so prolific
The dreams I fulfilled it
Thought you knew? Got them goose bump rhymes cause it bump
But you felt it, that's real shit
See them tryna bring me down, but homie I built this
See the cops and we turn the dopiness down a lil' bit
I won't quit, I been in this since I was a lil' kid
Not only my flow but the red carpet silky
Still stay the slang I made, you could say I paved the way
The trail I blazed, yo, just raise my pay
I face the day, I do it in a major way
It ain't the floor she upon so no Major Laze'
The ace of spades I po' it, really though I don't show it
Cause I got a bunch of them in my poker hand
Yeah, I'm the financier and the broker man

From the land before time, my co-sign's that this whole time I've never been off my grind
Dial in my hotline, you drop dimes need to stop snitchin'

Made the decision to really just start spittin' and kill em
Made the decision to really just start spittin' and kill em...

Also known by the name C. Noteriety
Y'all ain't half as fly as me if you had one wing
Finna push it to the limit like a drug kingpin
It seems like America just knows one thing
Put our values on pause for some entertainment
So many people in charge you couldn't even blame them
Get it or I gotta come in layman's?
Remember better days when and wonder where them days went
And how we lost our innocence in a sense
But ever since I've been the main event, what I represent?
Better than you ever been, ah, I let that settle in
I turn it up to eleven when I get it in
It all depends on the remedies, I got em passed down the like medicine man
And I'ma, make sure they remember it man

And now it's like hot damn, you know who I am

Faded Youth,rock,Rescuer,2013,21,{},"Feel the years cut like stone through every promise made, every memory
And I'll find a way to laugh as we look back to those days
And what we thought we knew
Through the static of the past we'll squint our eyes and say
""I can see it all fading away
Fading away.""
It comes to me now as a silhouette
I'll spend the rest of my life in the shadow of yesterdays
In the best of intentions, failure has found its home
It's as if I've lost my will to grow, finding comfort in stagnant dreams
Stare into the eyes of the ones I love and find people I'll never know

Im Comin Home,pop,Robert Earl Keen,1994,343,{},"Packed my suitcase, I racked my brain
I bought a ticket on the late night train
Took a taxi through the pourin' rain
I'm comin' home to you

Flew from Boston out to San Jose
Saw our old friends in Monterey Bay
When they asked me if I'd like to stay, I said
I'm comin' home to you

I'm comin' home
Made up my mind that's what I'm gonna do
Can't love nobody on the telephone
I'm comin' home to you

They threw a party there from dusk till' dawn
Seems like everybody knows ol' Sleepy John
He says next time I down here, bring you along
I'm comin' home to you

There's fresh caught salmon on the bar-b-q's
There were people jammin' to the all nite blues
Life is good out in Santa Cruz, but
I'm comin' home to you
I'm comin' home
Made up my mind that's what I'm gonna do
Can't love nobody on the telephone
I'm comin' home to you

I drove wherever -- out to god knows where
Come 10:30 there was no one there
They couldn't pay me, but I didn't care
I'm comin' home to you

I'm feelin' better since I got your card
I read it over and over when the road gets hard
Ain't nothin' better than your own backyard
I'm comin' home to you

I'm comin' home
Made up my mind that's what I'm gonna do
Can't love nobody on the telephone

Aim for the fame
Drop number ones

The chips on the table I bet on my self, always
Stay with a poker face, these days
To many of you be announcing your plans beforehand
Raising the stakes on your own plan
You flex on 'gram
I'm figuring out how to add me in to the end of nominee list for the best in the game
Got to stay humble
I know my place
Don't hop the wave
Stay in my lane
Don't crash
Wash up like a plank from the ship we all know as relation
Leverage yourself
Every occasion you got or get treated expendable
The industry ain't that commendable

I got myself in this, I'll get myself out
I talk out loud, at the top of my voice I sing
Whoa keep the faith, see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus]
I can't get over you
Try as I may oh it no use
My heart just can't leave you alone
My mind won't believe you're gone
I can't get over you

[Verse 2]
I got a front row seat here to a fool's masquerade
And that fool in the mirror keeps saying I'm doing OK
I stare at that door that you walked out
It hits me hard and leaves no doubt

Remember that feel of my hands running through your hair on your bedroom floor
Caught in the thrill of a life spending cash on shit that we can't afford
No, this ain’t the end, no, I'm not dissuaded by your demeanor
And if you forget, the memories fade, I'll be your timekeeper
’Cause I want you more, more, more

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, baby
Ooh, ooh, baby
More, more, more
Ooh, ooh, baby
Ooh, ooh, baby

[Verse 1]
Show you that first date at the ramen place
When I picked you up late, we were happy that day
You told me 'bout your family, how they hate all your decisions
But you never felt it heavy, and you still had vision
Show you that first night when we just had sex
When your eyes rolled back to the back of your head
But now you're so damn mean, is it a cultural thing?
Guess that you forgot that night when you called me a dream, heavy
[Pre-Chorus]
And you cannot even tell me what's the reason
But you're addicted to a loneliness, that feeling
(Those flowers didn't help, huh?)
You say it's in your head, you blamed the seasons
(Shit, I hate this cold, too)
But you're addicted to a sadness, to that feeling
(Whatever, just stay on your phone)

[Chorus]
Remember that feel of my hands running through your hair on your bedroom floor
Caught in the thrill of a life spending cash on shit that we can’t afford
No, this ain’t the end, no, I'm not dissuaded by your demeanor
And if you forget, the memories fade, I’ll be your timekeeper
'Cause I want you more, more, more

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, baby
Ooh, ooh, baby (I want you)
More, more, more
Ooh, ooh, baby (Oh)
Ooh, ooh, baby

[Verse 2]
Show you that first fight at Hodges Bend
When we talked it all out, sealed it up in a kiss
But then you had another drink, said you could not feel it
'Til you threw that glass at me, when you saw I looked at him (Fuck)
Jealousy is quite a bitch, and you thought that I was joking when I offered the hitch
I don't need all the memories to know we’re A-team
And if you can't see that, then fucking leave, babe
[Pre-Chorus]
You can't even tell me what's the reason
(Goodbye, RK)
But you're addicted to a loneliness, that feeling
(Guess I'll see you another day)
You say it's in your head, you blamed the seasons
(And to RB, too)
But you're addicted to a sadness, to that feeling
(Just keep that focus on you)

[Chorus]
Remember that feel of my hands running through your hair on your bedroom floor
Caught in the thrill of a life spending cash on shit that we can't afford
No, this ain't the end, no, I'm not dissuaded by your demeanor
And if you forget, the memories fade, I'll be your timekeeper
'Cause I want you more, more, more
Mmm, baby, I want you more",4271950,en,en,en

She suck on my dick like it’s a popsicle
Snatching my chain, that shit is impossible
I'm finna pop that nigga like a cork

He ate the pork with a dirty fork

Nigga weak as fuck

Knock you to the ground you is a domino
Kissing yo bitch under the mistletoe

Got so much money my wallet on overflow
Sucking it sloppy like it is Sloppy Joe

I'm sipping that dirty like water with lead
Fuck Miami and fuck Homestead
Y’all killed them big homies left them niggas dead
I’ll cut you off like some thread
Choppa eat you up like some cornbread
We run in yo house, you under the covers
I don’t work a job but I am plumber
Nigga you're shit, I gotta use a plunger
Shredding yo money with a paper cutter
New Wraith, give a fuck bout the color
Yo bitch was tasty like a Nutter Butter
He smoking the woods he smoking the lumber
He think he is hard like a hurricane shutter
Nigga we playing hide and seek, but I’m gonna find ya, might as well peek
Turn you into yogurt that shit was Greek
I just fucked yo bitch she was a freak

Fire Marshall Willy,pop,The Dreadnoughts,2007,2586,{},"When the night is cold and the hours are long
I think about good times now long since gone
But no memory pleases me more to recall
Than the night that dear Willy came out on a crawl

He was 18 for a few hours more
I fed him some whisky as he walked through my door
The sounds of a house-party rolled down the street
So we pounded our Pilsner and leapt to our feet

Oh he had his filling
Tequila swilling
Oh he put out the flames
And it earned him the name
Fire marshal Willy

Oh we led him away to the depths of the house
With Jose Cuervo and Old Famous Grouse
He took 15 shots in the blink of an eye
Fell under the porch by the bbq side
And they told him just sit down instead
Do touch that extinguisher shiny and red
But William was drunk as I'd ere seen a man
And so the insanity surely began

Oh he had his filling
Tequila swilling
Oh he put out the flames
And it earned him the name
Fire marshal Willy

10 minutes later he flashed me a smile
There wasn't combustion within 20 miles
He'd hosed every chap in the whole fucking place
And threw his cold water right in Justine's face

When the night is cold and the hours are long
I think about good times now long since gone
But no memory gives me more pleasure then
Than the night that dear Willy became a new man

Oh he had his filling
Tequila swilling
Oh he put out the flames
And it earned him the name
Fire marshal Willy
Oh he had his filling
Tequila swilling
Oh he put out the flames
And it earned him the name",1488454,en,en,en

2 faced, what's behind the curtain
No woes or hoes approximately near
SportsNation's biggest jeer
Actions and words don't conform, with no correlation, unparalleled and unrelateable
Striving for the next Arnold is simply unobtainable
Boxed in like container would
You go, but are no pro, for sho
Filmin', no reason to go pro
Inconsistent levels, boomerang, yo-yo, no Pinocchio but nose grows
Head honcho since ?, bars more amaizeing than corn rows
Viewed as a homo with all them low blows
Paved the way, and now you follow like Todo
How you claimin' you the major key when you not unlock your doors
Mind so immature, thought you was wettin' them drawers
Stoled my swagger, everybody knows that's not yours
Nobody believes in you, we all agnostic, O'lawd
Not saying anybody is a snitch but not saying nobody told, broke code, oh no
The hate won't make me flinch, no, won't make me fold
You probably would so I hit you twice
Nothing common about me, not my rice
Bottom line, I'm doing what I do and I do what I have to
Just do it top of the line, stay on my grind
Shine on the low, basement light
Get high, stay low
Frontin' your dough, no french toast
Cruise control, I coast
Like I'm on yacht, ya
How you lost in the sauce when you got no pasta
...must be a noodle, fuck I lost ya
You think you Bron-Bron in M.I.A., just a bum bum who's MIA
One took talents to south beach and got that ring
One's delusional and got no bling
One really balls and got that heat
One really falls and sits that seat
See that geek squad with you, with no computers
See you working, seems everyday is on Ferris Bueller
Really man, I fuck's with you; I don't bluff, purport, or pretend to
Just showing who's the king and who's the wing-
Man, my coats greeting longer, get off my tail
Whether I'm stronger or not, imma hail
Weezy warned us about the Chips & Dales and them little gals
Not to get in the shoo-shoo and who's who but you turned boo boo
Games you playin', barely able to guess who
Shit stanks like doo doo
Loose goose who's loose as a goose
Loopin' around like a hula-hoop for verse 2
Spot up my lines like a hoop, I sharp shoot
Swoosh, you don't deserve 2
Dodging loopholes like bullshit
Got more thrown at me than manure pit
Continue to grow with no fertilize, I see you petrified
Legacy arise, and alive after a die
Just had to sanitize negative vibes before I brought out the 9's",4034677,en,en,en

I know it’s all because I fear
That you were never gonna love me if I ended up with nothing if you saw me disappear

I gave my soul away for all of my fans but that was never really part of the plans
But I knew that it was comin' when I had to give up everything I felt like it was slippin' through my hands

When I needed you the most you tore me down and did it happily
First you love me and you hated and you laughed at me?
The second that I posted 20K and now you're back to me? I don't think so

I made amends for all the people that I hurt
But half of you people just wanted to see me in the dirt
From the ashes I arose like the phoenix in the sky
My sobriety the catalyst believing it could work

Shit...I don’t know man

*Clear Throat*

[Verse 1]
Okay
Year ninety-nine where it all begins
At the age of ten, my heart was in this pen
Lord still blessin’ me even though I sin
Back then, use to wake up early In the mornin’, just to watch some Animaniacs and Static Shock, be in front of the Tv screen with my bowl of cereal and dirty socks
Now In high school, I’m dressin’ like everybody else and twistin’ my hair just to have some dreadlocks
Hold up...where’s pops?, For some reason he’s always gone
And now momma over here complainin’ about bein’ alone
This house doesn’t feel like home
Wanna runaway but I’m scared to end up on my own
So I go in my room, lock the door and be in my zone
With my notebook, laid back with my headphones
Pops said, “That rappin’ shit ain’t meant for you”
Fuck you, I'd rather die than listen to you
I don’t hate him, I just hate the fact that he think I’m “one of them”
Trust me pops, I’ll never be none of them
L. Mitchell, I’m the son of him
L. Shelby, tell him I said “Fuck him!”
Make one proud and make the other hate me
Hope momma scream my name out loud, tellin’ people that she made me
It’s all fuckin’ crazy, cause momma taught me how to talk like this
See that “Confidence Walk” Mitchell is the reason why I walk like this
Fuck bein’ a rapper, I wanna be known as an artist
Fuck rappin’ about bullshit, I wanna rap about the darkest
While everybody’s asleep
I’m up thinkin’ my hardest, this rap gotta be somethin’ deep cause I’ma motherfuckin’ artist

Uh
Tryna look cleaner
Tryna get a bad bitch that look like Trina
Nah I’m kiddin’, I’m actually lookin’ for a girl who’s always focus
Fuck a Trina, I need me a Poetic Justice
Need me a real one, who wears baggy jeans and baseball shirts
A real one, who talk about her dreams and write poetry explainin’ why she’s always hurt
Read it for myself and become a fan of her work
After reading each other piece, we might be able to relate
Cause we both talk about love more than hate
Fuck dying perfect, I wanna die great
You ain’t a real legend if you never made mistakes
Step on stage, you hear a little girl screamin’ “that’s uncle Leo” she’s only two years old and already I’m her hero

Have I been falling down?
Lost in the dark
With no answers left
I don't remember
Now I roam all alone
Searching for an answer
For a reason to stand up and stay

Waiting for a guiding light
Breaking through this silent night
Where my dreams are free to fly
Far away

Fly, now I fly
And the night is no more part of my life
No more
Just follow me
And you will see the place I've seen before
My life no more
How many nights
Have I been alone?
Lost in my thoughts
Searching for your face
I can't remember
Looking up to the sky
Where the moonlight sparkles
Melting with a billion galaxies

Waiting for a guiding light
Breaking through this silent night
Where my dreams are free to fly
Far Away

Demanding all

Caught a few stings, rocked the phat rope cables

Carved on your faces with chisel
Of hypocrisy and and stupefaction

And cruel in equality
Burying hearts which neither potency
To righteousness nor infamous deeds
Cannot change their nature of meat
Nor destiny of being fertilizer
For another human larva!

Carrying in right hand a mace of despair
Despite morbid fascination
Within walls of disability turns into jealousy
Blasphemous consumption
And transcendental hallucinations
Unworthy of heart beating become

Yet deathlike frost around
A fierce thirst is oppressing still

In ashes and shadows we straighten up
Devastating through creating not!
Clasping handful of soil
Into the abyss ready to plunge ourselves with

This beat almost HAM
Have my young niggs follow dem
To the crib and hollow dem

Where we live its not ok
But its been here so we stay
Know the bread won't go away

Top down through the Golden State
Sun rays screamin off my paint
Sun rays through the solar panel

Rest in peace to the young Bo Daniel

King Freak just like my family
Mac Dre just like a family

Rich City, clips empty
My kids gon have a rich history
From this victory, niggas whispering
Get outta line and I'm 30 dickin him
All hail J.A., long live the king
Woke up one day living all my dreams
Why you fake niggas don't live at all these days
Here with Islam when I thought I lost my way
Here the Jack come now you numb, you lost your taste
Cuz this shit pure, gettin high in a mirror
Higher than a Lear flyin at Top Gear
Smoke a million RAW's but it don't stop there
I don't really care, cuz its just not fair
Bout to wake up your hood but it's kids out there
Hate my enemy, even his out there
We the MOB gotta stand by the rules that I wear
On my sleeve to achieve bigger roles that we playin
And my young niggs lifed, so the MOB always win
Yo, real niggas always win, but we still gotta die in the end

Reminiscing while you’re incarcerated

You don’t want no free smoke

Off sides like how Worf rides with Starfleet

Beautiful Ghost/Introduction to Songs of Experience,pop,U2,2004,1468,{},"Hear the voice of the bard
Who present past and future sees
Whose ears have heard
The holy word
That walk among the ancient trees

Calling the lapsed soul
And weeping in the evening dew
That might control
The starry pole
And fallen, fallen light renew

Oh Earth, Oh Earth return
Arise from out the dewy grass
Night is worn
And the morn
Rises from the slumberous mass

Turn away no more
Why wilt thou turn away

The watery shore
Is given thee till the break of day

Stanzas in Memory of the Author of Obermann,misc,Matthew Arnold,2013,10,{},"In front the awful Alpine track
Crawls up its rocky stair;
The autumn storm-winds drive the rack,
Close o'er it, in the air.

Behind are the abandon'd baths
Mute in their meadows lone;
The leaves are on the valley-paths,
The mists are on the Rhone—

The white mists rolling like a sea!
I hear the torrents roar.
—Yes, Obermann, all speaks of thee;
I feel thee near once more!

I turn thy leaves! I feel their breath
Once more upon me roll;
That air of languor, cold, and death,
Which brooded o'er thy soul.

Fly hence, poor wretch, whoe'er thou art,
Condemn'd to cast about,
All shipwreck in thy own weak heart,
For comfort from without!
A fever in these pages burns
Beneath the calm they feign;
A wounded human spirit turns,
Here, on its bed of pain.

Yes, though the virgin mountain-air
Fresh through these pages blows;
Though to these leaves the glaciers spare
The soul of their white snows;

Though here a mountain-murmur swells
Of many a dark-bough'd pine;
Though, as you read, you hear the bells
Of the high-pasturing kine—

Yet, through the hum of torrent lone,
And brooding mountain-bee,
There sobs I know not what ground-tone
Of human agony.

Is it for this, because the sound
Is fraught too deep with pain,
That, Obermann! the world around
So little loves thy strain?

Some secrets may the poet tell,
For the world loves new ways;
To tell too deep ones is not well—
It knows not what he says.
Yet, of the spirits who have reign'd
In this our troubled day,
I know but two, who have attain'd,
Save thee, to see their way.

By England's lakes, in grey old age,
His quiet home one keeps;
And one, the strong much-toiling sage,
In German Weimar sleeps.

But Wordsworth's eyes avert their ken
From half of human fate;
And Goethe's course few sons of men
May think to emulate.

For he pursued a lonely road,
His eyes on Nature's plan;
Neither made man too much a God,
Nor God too much a man.

Strong was he, with a spirit free
From mists, and sane, and clear;
Clearer, how much! than ours—yet we
Have a worse course to steer.

For though his manhood bore the blast
Of a tremendous time,
Yet in a tranquil world was pass'd
His tenderer youthful prime.
But we, brought forth and rear'd in hours
Of change, alarm, surprise—
What shelter to grow ripe is ours?
What leisure to grow wise?

Like children bathing on the shore,
Buried a wave beneath,
The second wave succeeds, before
We have had time to breathe.

Too fast we live, too much are tried,
Too harass'd, to attain
Wordsworth's sweet calm, or Goethe's wide
And luminous view to gain.

And then we turn, thou sadder sage,
To thee! we feel thy spell!
—The hopeless tangle of our age,
Thou too hast scann'd it well!

Immoveable thou sittest, still
As death, composed to bear!
Thy head is clear, thy feeling chill,
And icy thy despair.

Yes, as the son of Thetis said,
I hear thee saying now:
Greater by far than thou art dead;
Strive not! die also thou!

Ah! two desires toss about
The poet's feverish blood.
One drives him to the world without,
And one to solitude.

The glow, he cries, the thrill of life,
Where, where do these abound?—
Not in the world, not in the strife
Of men, shall they be found.

He who hath watch'd, not shared, the strife,
Knows how the day hath gone.
He only lives with the world's life,
Who hath renounced his own.

To thee we come, then! Clouds are roll'd
Where thou, O seer! art set;
Thy realm of thought is drear and cold—
The world is colder yet!

And thou hast pleasures, too, to share
With those who come to thee—
Balms floating on thy mountain-air,
And healing sights to see.

How often, where the slopes are green
On Jaman, hast thou sate
By some high chalet-door, and seen
The summer-day grow late;

And darkness steal o'er the wet grass
With the pale crocus starr'd,
And reach that glimmering sheet of glass
Beneath the piny sward,

Lake Leman's waters, far below!
And watch'd the rosy light
Fade from the distant peaks of snow;
And on the air of night

Heard accents of the eternal tongue
Through the pine branches play—
Listen'd, and felt thyself grow young!
Listen'd and wept——Away!

Away the dreams that but deceive
And thou, sad guide, adieu!
I go, fate drives me; but I leave
Half of my life with you.

We, in some unknown Power's employ,
Move on a rigorous line;
Can neither, when we will, enjoy,
Nor, when we will, resign.

I in the world must live; but thou,
Thou melancholy shade!
Wilt not, if thou canst see me now,
Condemn me, nor upbraid.

For thou art gone away from earth,
And place with those dost claim,
The Children of the Second Birth,
Whom the world could not tame;

And with that small, transfigured band,
Whom many a different way
Conducted to their common land,
Thou learn'st to think as they.

Christian and pagan, king and slave,
Soldier and anchorite,
Distinctions we esteem so grave,
Are nothing in their sight.

They do not ask, who pined unseen,
Who was on action hurl'd,
Whose one bond is, that all have been
Unspotted by the world.

There without anger thou wilt see
Him who obeys thy spell
No more, so he but rest, like thee,
Unsoil'd!—and so, farewell.

Farewell!—Whether thou now liest near
That much-loved inland sea,
The ripples of whose blue waves cheer
Vevey and Meillerie:

And in that gracious region bland,
Where with clear-rustling wave
The scented pines of Switzerland
Stand dark round thy green grave,

Between the dusty vineyard-walls
Issuing on that green place
The early peasant still recalls
The pensive stranger's face,

And stoops to clear thy moss-grown date
Ere he plods on again;—
Or whether, by maligner fate,
Among the swarms of men,

Where between granite terraces
The blue Seine rolls her wave,
The Capital of Pleasure sees
The hardly heard-of grave;—

Farewell! Under the sky we part,
In the stern Alpine dell.
O unstrung will! O broken heart!
A last, a last farewell!",170217,en,en,en

The Secret Agent Chap. 8,misc,Joseph Conrad,1907,36,{},"Having infused by persistent importunities some sort of heat into the chilly interest of several licensed victuallers (the acquaintances once upon a time of her late unlucky husband), Mrs Verloc’s mother had at last secured her admission to certain almshouses founded by a wealthy innkeeper for the destitute widows of the trade.

This end, conceived in the astuteness of her uneasy heart, the old woman had pursued with secrecy and determination.  That was the time when her daughter Winnie could not help passing a remark to Mr Verloc that “mother has been spending half-crowns and five shillings almost every day this last week in cab fares.”  But the remark was not made grudgingly.  Winnie respected her mother’s infirmities.  She was only a little surprised at this sudden mania for locomotion.  Mr Verloc, who was sufficiently magnificent in his way, had grunted the remark impatiently aside as interfering with his meditations.  These were frequent, deep, and prolonged; they bore upon a matter more important than five shillings.  Distinctly more important, and beyond all comparison more difficult to consider in all its aspects with philosophical serenity.

Her object attained in astute secrecy, the heroic old woman had made a clean breast of it to Mrs Verloc.  Her soul was triumphant and her heart tremulous.  Inwardly she quaked, because she dreaded and admired the calm, self-contained character of her daughter Winnie, whose displeasure was made redoubtable by a diversity of dreadful silences.  But she did not allow her inward apprehensions to rob her of the advantage of venerable placidity conferred upon her outward person by her triple chin, the floating ampleness of her ancient form, and the impotent condition of her legs.

The shock of the information was so unexpected that Mrs Verloc, against her usual practice when addressed, interrupted the domestic occupation she was engaged upon.  It was the dusting of the furniture in the parlour behind the shop.  She turned her head towards her mother.

“Whatever did you want to do that for?” she exclaimed, in scandalised astonishment.

The shock must have been severe to make her depart from that distant and uninquiring acceptance of facts which was her force and her safeguard in life.

“Weren’t you made comfortable enough here?”

She had lapsed into these inquiries, but next moment she saved the consistency of her conduct by resuming her dusting, while the old woman sat scared and dumb under her dingy white cap and lustreless dark wig.

Winnie finished the chair, and ran the duster along the mahogany at the back of the horse-hair sofa on which Mr Verloc loved to take his ease in hat and overcoat.  She was intent on her work, but presently she permitted herself another question.

“How in the world did you manage it, mother?”

As not affecting the inwardness of things, which it was Mrs Verloc’s principle to ignore, this curiosity was excusable.  It bore merely on the methods.  The old woman welcomed it eagerly as bringing forward something that could be talked about with much sincerity.
She favoured her daughter by an exhaustive answer, full of names and enriched by side comments upon the ravages of time as observed in the alteration of human countenances.  The names were principally the names of licensed victuallers—“poor daddy’s friends, my dear.”  She enlarged with special appreciation on the kindness and condescension of a large brewer, a Baronet and an M. P., the Chairman of the Governors of the Charity.  She expressed herself thus warmly because she had been allowed to interview by appointment his Private Secretary—“a very polite gentleman, all in black, with a gentle, sad voice, but so very, very thin and quiet.  He was like a shadow, my dear.”

Winnie, prolonging her dusting operations till the tale was told to the end, walked out of the parlour into the kitchen (down two steps) in her usual manner, without the slightest comment.

Shedding a few tears in sign of rejoicing at her daughter’s mansuetude in this terrible affair, Mrs Verloc’s mother gave play to her astuteness in the direction of her furniture, because it was her own; and sometimes she wished it hadn’t been.  Heroism is all very well, but there are circumstances when the disposal of a few tables and chairs, brass bedsteads, and so on, may be big with remote and disastrous consequences.  She required a few pieces herself, the Foundation which, after many importunities, had gathered her to its charitable breast, giving nothing but bare planks and cheaply papered bricks to the objects of its solicitude.  The delicacy guiding her choice to the least valuable and most dilapidated articles passed unacknowledged, because Winnie’s philosophy consisted in not taking notice of the inside of facts; she assumed that mother took what suited her best.  As to Mr Verloc, his intense meditation, like a sort of Chinese wall, isolated him completely from the phenomena of this world of vain effort and illusory appearances.

Her selection made, the disposal of the rest became a perplexing question in a particular way.  She was leaving it in Brett Street, of course.  But she had two children.  Winnie was provided for by her sensible union with that excellent husband, Mr Verloc.  Stevie was destitute—and a little peculiar.  His position had to be considered before the claims of legal justice and even the promptings of partiality.  The possession of the furniture would not be in any sense a provision.  He ought to have it—the poor boy.  But to give it to him would be like tampering with his position of complete dependence.  It was a sort of claim which she feared to weaken.  Moreover, the susceptibilities of Mr Verloc would perhaps not brook being beholden to his brother-in-law for the chairs he sat on.  In a long experience of gentlemen lodgers, Mrs Verloc’s mother had acquired a dismal but resigned notion of the fantastic side of human nature.  What if Mr Verloc suddenly took it into his head to tell Stevie to take his blessed sticks somewhere out of that?  A division, on the other hand, however carefully made, might give some cause of offence to Winnie.  No, Stevie must remain destitute and dependent.  And at the moment of leaving Brett Street she had said to her daughter: “No use waiting till I am dead, is there?  Everything I leave here is altogether your own now, my dear.”

Winnie, with her hat on, silent behind her mother’s back, went on arranging the collar of the old woman’s cloak.  She got her hand-bag, an umbrella, with an impassive face.  The time had come for the expenditure of the sum of three-and-sixpence on what might well be supposed the last cab drive of Mrs Verloc’s mother’s life.  They went out at the shop door.

The conveyance awaiting them would have illustrated the proverb that “truth can be more cruel than caricature,” if such a proverb existed.  Crawling behind an infirm horse, a metropolitan hackney carriage drew up on wobbly wheels and with a maimed driver on the box.  This last peculiarity caused some embarrassment.  Catching sight of a hooked iron contrivance protruding from the left sleeve of the man’s coat, Mrs Verloc’s mother lost suddenly the heroic courage of these days.  She really couldn’t trust herself.  “What do you think, Winnie?”  She hung back.  The passionate expostulations of the big-faced cabman seemed to be squeezed out of a blocked throat.  Leaning over from his box, he whispered with mysterious indignation.  What was the matter now?  Was it possible to treat a man so?  His enormous and unwashed countenance flamed red in the muddy stretch of the street.  Was it likely they would have given him a licence, he inquired desperately, if—

The police constable of the locality quieted him by a friendly glance; then addressing himself to the two women without marked consideration, said:

“He’s been driving a cab for twenty years.  I never knew him to have an accident.”

“Accident!” shouted the driver in a scornful whisper.

The policeman’s testimony settled it.  The modest assemblage of seven people, mostly under age, dispersed.  Winnie followed her mother into the cab.  Stevie climbed on the box.  His vacant mouth and distressed eyes depicted the state of his mind in regard to the transactions which were taking place.  In the narrow streets the progress of the journey was made sensible to those within by the near fronts of the houses gliding past slowly and shakily, with a great rattle and jingling of glass, as if about to collapse behind the cab; and the infirm horse, with the harness hung over his sharp backbone flapping very loose about his thighs, appeared to be dancing mincingly on his toes with infinite patience.  Later on, in the wider space of Whitehall, all visual evidences of motion became imperceptible.  The rattle and jingle of glass went on indefinitely in front of the long Treasury building—and time itself seemed to stand still.

At last Winnie observed: “This isn’t a very good horse.”

Her eyes gleamed in the shadow of the cab straight ahead, immovable.  On the box, Stevie shut his vacant mouth first, in order to ejaculate earnestly: “Don’t.”

The driver, holding high the reins twisted around the hook, took no notice.  Perhaps he had not heard.  Stevie’s breast heaved.
“Don’t whip.”

The man turned slowly his bloated and sodden face of many colours bristling with white hairs.  His little red eyes glistened with moisture.  His big lips had a violet tint.  They remained closed.  With the dirty back of his whip-hand he rubbed the stubble sprouting on his enormous chin.

“You mustn’t,” stammered out Stevie violently.  “It hurts.”

“Mustn’t whip,” queried the other in a thoughtful whisper, and immediately whipped.  He did this, not because his soul was cruel and his heart evil, but because he had to earn his fare.  And for a time the walls of St Stephen’s, with its towers and pinnacles, contemplated in immobility and silence a cab that jingled.  It rolled too, however.  But on the bridge there was a commotion.  Stevie suddenly proceeded to get down from the box.  There were shouts on the pavement, people ran forward, the driver pulled up, whispering curses of indignation and astonishment.  Winnie lowered the window, and put her head out, white as a ghost.  In the depths of the cab, her mother was exclaiming, in tones of anguish: “Is that boy hurt?  Is that boy hurt?”

Stevie was not hurt, he had not even fallen, but excitement as usual had robbed him of the power of connected speech.  He could do no more than stammer at the window.  “Too heavy.  Too heavy.”  Winnie put out her hand on to his shoulder.

“Stevie!  Get up on the box directly, and don’t try to get down again.”

“No.  No.  Walk.  Must walk.”

In trying to state the nature of that necessity he stammered himself into utter incoherence.  No physical impossibility stood in the way of his whim.  Stevie could have managed easily to keep pace with the infirm, dancing horse without getting out of breath.  But his sister withheld her consent decisively.  “The idea!  Whoever heard of such a thing!  Run after a cab!”  Her mother, frightened and helpless in the depths of the conveyance, entreated: “Oh, don’t let him, Winnie.  He’ll get lost.  Don’t let him.”

“Certainly not.  What next!  Mr Verloc will be sorry to hear of this nonsense, Stevie,—I can tell you.  He won’t be happy at all.”

The idea of Mr Verloc’s grief and unhappiness acting as usual powerfully upon Stevie’s fundamentally docile disposition, he abandoned all resistance, and climbed up again on the box, with a face of despair.

The cabby turned at him his enormous and inflamed countenance truculently.  “Don’t you go for trying this silly game again, young fellow.”

After delivering himself thus in a stern whisper, strained almost to extinction, he drove on, ruminating solemnly.  To his mind the incident remained somewhat obscure.  But his intellect, though it had lost its pristine vivacity in the benumbing years of sedentary exposure to the weather, lacked not independence or sanity.  Gravely he dismissed the hypothesis of Stevie being a drunken young nipper.

Inside the cab the spell of silence, in which the two women had endured shoulder to shoulder the jolting, rattling, and jingling of the journey, had been broken by Stevie’s outbreak.  Winnie raised her voice.
“You’ve done what you wanted, mother.  You’ll have only yourself to thank for it if you aren’t happy afterwards.  And I don’t think you’ll be.  That I don’t.  Weren’t you comfortable enough in the house?  Whatever people’ll think of us—you throwing yourself like this on a Charity?”

“My dear,” screamed the old woman earnestly above the noise, “you’ve been the best of daughters to me.  As to Mr Verloc—there—”

Words failing her on the subject of Mr Verloc’s excellence, she turned her old tearful eyes to the roof of the cab.  Then she averted her head on the pretence of looking out of the window, as if to judge of their progress.  It was insignificant, and went on close to the curbstone.  Night, the early dirty night, the sinister, noisy, hopeless and rowdy night of South London, had overtaken her on her last cab drive.  In the gas-light of the low-fronted shops her big cheeks glowed with an orange hue under a black and mauve bonnet.

Mrs Verloc’s mother’s complexion had become yellow by the effect of age and from a natural predisposition to biliousness, favoured by the trials of a difficult and worried existence, first as wife, then as widow.  It was a complexion, that under the influence of a blush would take on an orange tint.  And this woman, modest indeed but hardened in the fires of adversity, of an age, moreover, when blushes are not expected, had positively blushed before her daughter.  In the privacy of a four-wheeler, on her way to a charity cottage (one of a row) which by the exiguity of its dimensions and the simplicity of its accommodation, might well have been devised in kindness as a place of training for the still more straitened circumstances of the grave, she was forced to hid from her own child a blush of remorse and shame.

Whatever people will think?  She knew very well what they did think, the people Winnie had in her mind—the old friends of her husband, and others too, whose interest she had solicited with such flattering success.  She had not known before what a good beggar she could be.  But she guessed very well what inference was drawn from her application.  On account of that shrinking delicacy, which exists side by side with aggressive brutality in masculine nature, the inquiries into her circumstances had not been pushed very far.  She had checked them by a visible compression of the lips and some display of an emotion determined to be eloquently silent.  And the men would become suddenly incurious, after the manner of their kind.  She congratulated herself more than once on having nothing to do with women, who being naturally more callous and avid of details, would have been anxious to be exactly informed by what sort of unkind conduct her daughter and son-in-law had driven her to that sad extremity.  It was only before the Secretary of the great brewer M. P. and Chairman of the Charity, who, acting for his principal, felt bound to be conscientiously inquisitive as to the real circumstances of the applicant, that she had burst into tears outright and aloud, as a cornered woman will weep.  The thin and polite gentleman, after contemplating her with an air of being “struck all of a heap,” abandoned his position under the cover of soothing remarks.  She must not distress herself.  The deed of the Charity did not absolutely specify “childless widows.”  In fact, it did not by any means disqualify her.  But the discretion of the Committee must be an informed discretion.  One could understand very well her unwillingness to be a burden, etc. etc.  Thereupon, to his profound disappointment, Mrs Verloc’s mother wept some more with an augmented vehemence.

The tears of that large female in a dark, dusty wig, and ancient silk dress festooned with dingy white cotton lace, were the tears of genuine distress.  She had wept because she was heroic and unscrupulous and full of love for both her children.  Girls frequently get sacrificed to the welfare of the boys.  In this case she was sacrificing Winnie.  By the suppression of truth she was slandering her.  Of course, Winnie was independent, and need not care for the opinion of people that she would never see and who would never see her; whereas poor Stevie had nothing in the world he could call his own except his mother’s heroism and unscrupulousness.

The first sense of security following on Winnie’s marriage wore off in time (for nothing lasts), and Mrs Verloc’s mother, in the seclusion of the back bedroom, had recalled the teaching of that experience which the world impresses upon a widowed woman.  But she had recalled it without vain bitterness; her store of resignation amounted almost to dignity.  She reflected stoically that everything decays, wears out, in this world; that the way of kindness should be made easy to the well disposed; that her daughter Winnie was a most devoted sister, and a very self-confident wife indeed.  As regards Winnie’s sisterly devotion, her stoicism flinched.  She excepted that sentiment from the rule of decay affecting all things human and some things divine.  She could not help it; not to do so would have frightened her too much.  But in considering the conditions of her daughter’s married state, she rejected firmly all flattering illusions.  She took the cold and reasonable view that the less strain put on Mr Verloc’s kindness the longer its effects were likely to last.  That excellent man loved his wife, of course, but he would, no doubt, prefer to keep as few of her relations as was consistent with the proper display of that sentiment.  It would be better if its whole effect were concentrated on poor Stevie.  And the heroic old woman resolved on going away from her children as an act of devotion and as a move of deep policy.

The “virtue” of this policy consisted in this (Mrs Verloc’s mother was subtle in her way), that Stevie’s moral claim would be strengthened.  The poor boy—a good, useful boy, if a little peculiar—had not a sufficient standing.  He had been taken over with his mother, somewhat in the same way as the furniture of the Belgravian mansion had been taken over, as if on the ground of belonging to her exclusively.  What will happen, she asked herself (for Mrs Verloc’s mother was in a measure imaginative), when I die?  And when she asked herself that question it was with dread.  It was also terrible to think that she would not then have the means of knowing what happened to the poor boy.  But by making him over to his sister, by going thus away, she gave him the advantage of a directly dependent position.  This was the more subtle sanction of Mrs Verloc’s mother’s heroism and unscrupulousness.  Her act of abandonment was really an arrangement for settling her son permanently in life.  Other people made material sacrifices for such an object, she in that way.  It was the only way.  Moreover, she would be able to see how it worked.  Ill or well she would avoid the horrible incertitude on the death-bed.  But it was hard, hard, cruelly hard.

The cab rattled, jingled, jolted; in fact, the last was quite extraordinary.  By its disproportionate violence and magnitude it obliterated every sensation of onward movement; and the effect was of being shaken in a stationary apparatus like a mediæval device for the punishment of crime, or some very newfangled invention for the cure of a sluggish liver.  It was extremely distressing; and the raising of Mrs Verloc’s mother’s voice sounded like a wail of pain.

“I know, my dear, you’ll come to see me as often as you can spare the time.  Won’t you?”

“Of course,” answered Winnie shortly, staring straight before her.

And the cab jolted in front of a steamy, greasy shop in a blaze of gas and in the smell of fried fish.

The old woman raised a wail again.

“And, my dear, I must see that poor boy every Sunday.  He won’t mind spending the day with his old mother—”

Winnie screamed out stolidly:

“Mind!  I should think not.  That poor boy will miss you something cruel.  I wish you had thought a little of that, mother.”

Not think of it!  The heroic woman swallowed a playful and inconvenient object like a billiard ball, which had tried to jump out of her throat.  Winnie sat mute for a while, pouting at the front of the cab, then snapped out, which was an unusual tone with her:

“I expect I’ll have a job with him at first, he’ll be that restless—”

“Whatever you do, don’t let him worry your husband, my dear.”

Thus they discussed on familiar lines the bearings of a new situation.  And the cab jolted.  Mrs Verloc’s mother expressed some misgivings.  Could Stevie be trusted to come all that way alone?  Winnie maintained that he was much less “absent-minded” now.  They agreed as to that.  It could not be denied.  Much less—hardly at all.  They shouted at each other in the jingle with comparative cheerfulness.  But suddenly the maternal anxiety broke out afresh.  There were two omnibuses to take, and a short walk between.  It was too difficult!  The old woman gave way to grief and consternation.

Winnie stared forward.

“Don’t you upset yourself like this, mother.  You must see him, of course.”

“No, my dear.  I’ll try not to.”

She mopped her streaming eyes.

“But you can’t spare the time to come with him, and if he should forget himself and lose his way and somebody spoke to him sharply, his name and address may slip his memory, and he’ll remain lost for days and days—”

The vision of a workhouse infirmary for poor Stevie—if only during inquiries—wrung her heart.  For she was a proud woman.  Winnie’s stare had grown hard, intent, inventive.

“I can’t bring him to you myself every week,” she cried.  “But don’t you worry, mother.  I’ll see to it that he don’t get lost for long.”

They felt a peculiar bump; a vision of brick pillars lingered before the rattling windows of the cab; a sudden cessation of atrocious jolting and uproarious jingling dazed the two women.  What had happened?  They sat motionless and scared in the profound stillness, till the door came open, and a rough, strained whispering was heard:

“Here you are!”

A range of gabled little houses, each with one dim yellow window, on the ground floor, surrounded the dark open space of a grass plot planted with shrubs and railed off from the patchwork of lights and shadows in the wide road, resounding with the dull rumble of traffic.  Before the door of one of these tiny houses—one without a light in the little downstairs window—the cab had come to a standstill.  Mrs Verloc’s mother got out first, backwards, with a key in her hand.  Winnie lingered on the flagstone path to pay the cabman.  Stevie, after helping to carry inside a lot of small parcels, came out and stood under the light of a gas-lamp belonging to the Charity.  The cabman looked at the pieces of silver, which, appearing very minute in his big, grimy palm, symbolised the insignificant results which reward the ambitious courage and toil of a mankind whose day is short on this earth of evil.

He had been paid decently—four one-shilling pieces—and he contemplated them in perfect stillness, as if they had been the surprising terms of a melancholy problem.  The slow transfer of that treasure to an inner pocket demanded much laborious groping in the depths of decayed clothing.  His form was squat and without flexibility.  Stevie, slender, his shoulders a little up, and his hands thrust deep in the side pockets of his warm overcoat, stood at the edge of the path, pouting.

The cabman, pausing in his deliberate movements, seemed struck by some misty recollection.

“Oh!  ’Ere you are, young fellow,” he whispered.  “You’ll know him again—won’t you?”

Stevie was staring at the horse, whose hind quarters appeared unduly elevated by the effect of emaciation.  The little stiff tail seemed to have been fitted in for a heartless joke; and at the other end the thin, flat neck, like a plank covered with old horse-hide, drooped to the ground under the weight of an enormous bony head.  The ears hung at different angles, negligently; and the macabre figure of that mute dweller on the earth steamed straight up from ribs and backbone in the muggy stillness of the air.

The cabman struck lightly Stevie’s breast with the iron hook protruding from a ragged, greasy sleeve.

“Look ’ere, young feller.  ’Ow’d you like to sit behind this ’oss up to two o’clock in the morning p’raps?”

Stevie looked vacantly into the fierce little eyes with red-edged lids.

“He ain’t lame,” pursued the other, whispering with energy.  “He ain’t got no sore places on ’im.  ’Ere he is.  ’Ow would you like—”

His strained, extinct voice invested his utterance with a character of vehement secrecy.  Stevie’s vacant gaze was changing slowly into dread.

“You may well look!  Till three and four o’clock in the morning.  Cold and ’ungry.  Looking for fares.  Drunks.”

His jovial purple cheeks bristled with white hairs; and like Virgil’s Silenus, who, his face smeared with the juice of berries, discoursed of Olympian Gods to the innocent shepherds of Sicily, he talked to Stevie of domestic matters and the affairs of men whose sufferings are great and immortality by no means assured.

“I am a night cabby, I am,” he whispered, with a sort of boastful exasperation.  “I’ve got to take out what they will blooming well give me at the yard.  I’ve got my missus and four kids at ’ome.”

The monstrous nature of that declaration of paternity seemed to strike the world dumb.  A silence reigned during which the flanks of the old horse, the steed of apocalyptic misery, smoked upwards in the light of the charitable gas-lamp.

The cabman grunted, then added in his mysterious whisper:

“This ain’t an easy world.”  Stevie’s face had been twitching for some time, and at last his feelings burst out in their usual concise form.

“Bad!  Bad!”

His gaze remained fixed on the ribs of the horse, self-conscious and sombre, as though he were afraid to look about him at the badness of the world.  And his slenderness, his rosy lips and pale, clear complexion, gave him the aspect of a delicate boy, notwithstanding the fluffy growth of golden hair on his cheeks.  He pouted in a scared way like a child.  The cabman, short and broad, eyed him with his fierce little eyes that seemed to smart in a clear and corroding liquid.

“’Ard on ’osses, but dam’ sight ’arder on poor chaps like me,” he wheezed just audibly.

“Poor!  Poor!” stammered out Stevie, pushing his hands deeper into his pockets with convulsive sympathy.  He could say nothing; for the tenderness to all pain and all misery, the desire to make the horse happy and the cabman happy, had reached the point of a bizarre longing to take them to bed with him.  And that, he knew, was impossible.  For Stevie was not mad.  It was, as it were, a symbolic longing; and at the same time it was very distinct, because springing from experience, the mother of wisdom.  Thus when as a child he cowered in a dark corner scared, wretched, sore, and miserable with the black, black misery of the soul, his sister Winnie used to come along, and carry him off to bed with her, as into a heaven of consoling peace.  Stevie, though apt to forget mere facts, such as his name and address for instance, had a faithful memory of sensations.  To be taken into a bed of compassion was the supreme remedy, with the only one disadvantage of being difficult of application on a large scale.  And looking at the cabman, Stevie perceived this clearly, because he was reasonable.

The cabman went on with his leisurely preparations as if Stevie had not existed.  He made as if to hoist himself on the box, but at the last moment from some obscure motive, perhaps merely from disgust with carriage exercise, desisted.  He approached instead the motionless partner of his labours, and stooping to seize the bridle, lifted up the big, weary head to the height of his shoulder with one effort of his right arm, like a feat of strength.

“Come on,” he whispered secretly.

Limping, he led the cab away.  There was an air of austerity in this departure, the scrunched gravel of the drive crying out under the slowly turning wheels, the horse’s lean thighs moving with ascetic deliberation away from the light into the obscurity of the open space bordered dimly by the pointed roofs and the feebly shining windows of the little alms-houses.  The plaint of the gravel travelled slowly all round the drive.  Between the lamps of the charitable gateway the slow cortege reappeared, lighted up for a moment, the short, thick man limping busily, with the horse’s head held aloft in his fist, the lank animal walking in stiff and forlorn dignity, the dark, low box on wheels rolling behind comically with an air of waddling.  They turned to the left.  There was a pub down the street, within fifty yards of the gate.

Stevie left alone beside the private lamp-post of the Charity, his hands thrust deep into his pockets, glared with vacant sulkiness.  At the bottom of his pockets his incapable weak hands were clinched hard into a pair of angry fists.  In the face of anything which affected directly or indirectly his morbid dread of pain, Stevie ended by turning vicious.  A magnanimous indignation swelled his frail chest to bursting, and caused his candid eyes to squint.  Supremely wise in knowing his own powerlessness, Stevie was not wise enough to restrain his passions.  The tenderness of his universal charity had two phases as indissolubly joined and connected as the reverse and obverse sides of a medal.  The anguish of immoderate compassion was succeeded by the pain of an innocent but pitiless rage.  Those two states expressing themselves outwardly by the same signs of futile bodily agitation, his sister Winnie soothed his excitement without ever fathoming its twofold character.  Mrs Verloc wasted no portion of this transient life in seeking for fundamental information.  This is a sort of economy having all the appearances and some of the advantages of prudence.  Obviously it may be good for one not to know too much.  And such a view accords very well with constitutional indolence.

On that evening on which it may be said that Mrs Verloc’s mother having parted for good from her children had also departed this life, Winnie Verloc did not investigate her brother’s psychology.  The poor boy was excited, of course.  After once more assuring the old woman on the threshold that she would know how to guard against the risk of Stevie losing himself for very long on his pilgrimages of filial piety, she took her brother’s arm to walk away.  Stevie did not even mutter to himself, but with the special sense of sisterly devotion developed in her earliest infancy, she felt that the boy was very much excited indeed.  Holding tight to his arm, under the appearance of leaning on it, she thought of some words suitable to the occasion.

“Now, Stevie, you must look well after me at the crossings, and get first into the ’bus, like a good brother.”

This appeal to manly protection was received by Stevie with his usual docility.  It flattered him.  He raised his head and threw out his chest.

“Don’t be nervous, Winnie.  Mustn’t be nervous!  ’Bus all right,” he answered in a brusque, slurring stammer partaking of the timorousness of a child and the resolution of a man.  He advanced fearlessly with the woman on his arm, but his lower lip dropped.  Nevertheless, on the pavement of the squalid and wide thoroughfare, whose poverty in all the amenities of life stood foolishly exposed by a mad profusion of gas-lights, their resemblance to each other was so pronounced as to strike the casual passers-by.

Before the doors of the public-house at the corner, where the profusion of gas-light reached the height of positive wickedness, a four-wheeled cab standing by the curbstone with no one on the box, seemed cast out into the gutter on account of irremediable decay.  Mrs Verloc recognised the conveyance.  Its aspect was so profoundly lamentable, with such a perfection of grotesque misery and weirdness of macabre detail, as if it were the Cab of Death itself, that Mrs Verloc, with that ready compassion of a woman for a horse (when she is not sitting behind him), exclaimed vaguely:

“Poor brute!”

Hanging back suddenly, Stevie inflicted an arresting jerk upon his sister.

“Poor!  Poor!” he ejaculated appreciatively.  “Cabman poor too.  He told me himself.”

The contemplation of the infirm and lonely steed overcame him.  Jostled, but obstinate, he would remain there, trying to express the view newly opened to his sympathies of the human and equine misery in close association.  But it was very difficult.  “Poor brute, poor people!” was all he could repeat.  It did not seem forcible enough, and he came to a stop with an angry splutter: “Shame!”  Stevie was no master of phrases, and perhaps for that very reason his thoughts lacked clearness and precision.  But he felt with greater completeness and some profundity.  That little word contained all his sense of indignation and horror at one sort of wretchedness having to feed upon the anguish of the other—at the poor cabman beating the poor horse in the name, as it were, of his poor kids at home.  And Stevie knew what it was to be beaten.  He knew it from experience.  It was a bad world.  Bad!  Bad!

Mrs Verloc, his only sister, guardian, and protector, could not pretend to such depths of insight.  Moreover, she had not experienced the magic of the cabman’s eloquence.  She was in the dark as to the inwardness of the word “Shame.”  And she said placidly:

“Come along, Stevie.  You can’t help that.”

The docile Stevie went along; but now he went along without pride, shamblingly, and muttering half words, and even words that would have been whole if they had not been made up of halves that did not belong to each other.  It was as though he had been trying to fit all the words he could remember to his sentiments in order to get some sort of corresponding idea.  And, as a matter of fact, he got it at last.  He hung back to utter it at once.

“Bad world for poor people.”

Directly he had expressed that thought he became aware that it was familiar to him already in all its consequences.  This circumstance strengthened his conviction immensely, but also augmented his indignation.  Somebody, he felt, ought to be punished for it—punished with great severity.  Being no sceptic, but a moral creature, he was in a manner at the mercy of his righteous passions.

“Beastly!” he added concisely.

It was clear to Mrs Verloc that he was greatly excited.

“Nobody can help that,” she said.  “Do come along.  Is that the way you’re taking care of me?”

Stevie mended his pace obediently.  He prided himself on being a good brother.  His morality, which was very complete, demanded that from him.  Yet he was pained at the information imparted by his sister Winnie who was good.  Nobody could help that!  He came along gloomily, but presently he brightened up.  Like the rest of mankind, perplexed by the mystery of the universe, he had his moments of consoling trust in the organised powers of the earth.

“Police,” he suggested confidently.

“The police aren’t for that,” observed Mrs Verloc cursorily, hurrying on her way.

Stevie’s face lengthened considerably.  He was thinking.  The more intense his thinking, the slacker was the droop of his lower jaw.

And it was with an aspect of hopeless vacancy that he gave up his intellectual enterprise.

“Not for that?” he mumbled, resigned but surprised.  “Not for that?”  He had formed for himself an ideal conception of the metropolitan police as a sort of benevolent institution for the suppression of evil.  The notion of benevolence especially was very closely associated with his sense of the power of the men in blue.  He had liked all police constables tenderly, with a guileless trustfulness.  And he was pained.  He was irritated, too, by a suspicion of duplicity in the members of the force.  For Stevie was frank and as open as the day himself.  What did they mean by pretending then?  Unlike his sister, who put her trust in face values, he wished to go to the bottom of the matter.  He carried on his inquiry by means of an angry challenge.

“What for are they then, Winn?  What are they for?  Tell me.”

Winnie disliked controversy.  But fearing most a fit of black depression consequent on Stevie missing his mother very much at first, she did not altogether decline the discussion.  Guiltless of all irony, she answered yet in a form which was not perhaps unnatural in the wife of Mr Verloc, Delegate of the Central Red Committee, personal friend of certain anarchists, and a votary of social revolution.

“Don’t you know what the police are for, Stevie?  They are there so that them as have nothing shouldn’t take anything away from them who have.”

She avoided using the verb “to steal,” because it always made her brother uncomfortable.  For Stevie was delicately honest.  Certain simple principles had been instilled into him so anxiously (on account of his “queerness”) that the mere names of certain transgressions filled him with horror.  He had been always easily impressed by speeches.  He was impressed and startled now, and his intelligence was very alert.

“What?” he asked at once anxiously.  “Not even if they were hungry?  Mustn’t they?”

The two had paused in their walk.

“Not if they were ever so,” said Mrs Verloc, with the equanimity of a person untroubled by the problem of the distribution of wealth, and exploring the perspective of the roadway for an omnibus of the right colour.  “Certainly not.  But what’s the use of talking about all that?  You aren’t ever hungry.”

She cast a swift glance at the boy, like a young man, by her side.  She saw him amiable, attractive, affectionate, and only a little, a very little, peculiar.  And she could not see him otherwise, for he was connected with what there was of the salt of passion in her tasteless life—the passion of indignation, of courage, of pity, and even of self-sacrifice.  She did not add: “And you aren’t likely ever to be as long as I live.”  But she might very well have done so, since she had taken effectual steps to that end.  Mr Verloc was a very good husband.  It was her honest impression that nobody could help liking the boy.  She cried out suddenly:

“Quick, Stevie.  Stop that green ’bus.”

And Stevie, tremulous and important with his sister Winnie on his arm, flung up the other high above his head at the approaching ’bus, with complete success.

An hour afterwards Mr Verloc raised his eyes from a newspaper he was reading, or at any rate looking at, behind the counter, and in the expiring clatter of the door-bell beheld Winnie, his wife, enter and cross the shop on her way upstairs, followed by Stevie, his brother-in-law.  The sight of his wife was agreeable to Mr Verloc.  It was his idiosyncrasy.  The figure of his brother-in-law remained imperceptible to him because of the morose thoughtfulness that lately had fallen like a veil between Mr Verloc and the appearances of the world of senses.  He looked after his wife fixedly, without a word, as though she had been a phantom.  His voice for home use was husky and placid, but now it was heard not at all.  It was not heard at supper, to which he was called by his wife in the usual brief manner: “Adolf.”  He sat down to consume it without conviction, wearing his hat pushed far back on his head.  It was not devotion to an outdoor life, but the frequentation of foreign cafés which was responsible for that habit, investing with a character of unceremonious impermanency Mr Verloc’s steady fidelity to his own fireside.  Twice at the clatter of the cracked bell he arose without a word, disappeared into the shop, and came back silently.  During these absences Mrs Verloc, becoming acutely aware of the vacant place at her right hand, missed her mother very much, and stared stonily; while Stevie, from the same reason, kept on shuffling his feet, as though the floor under the table were uncomfortably hot.  When Mr Verloc returned to sit in his place, like the very embodiment of silence, the character of Mrs Verloc’s stare underwent a subtle change, and Stevie ceased to fidget with his feet, because of his great and awed regard for his sister’s husband.  He directed at him glances of respectful compassion.  Mr Verloc was sorry.  His sister Winnie had impressed upon him (in the omnibus) that Mr Verloc would be found at home in a state of sorrow, and must not be worried.  His father’s anger, the irritability of gentlemen lodgers, and Mr Verloc’s predisposition to immoderate grief, had been the main sanctions of Stevie’s self-restraint.  Of these sentiments, all easily provoked, but not always easy to understand, the last had the greatest moral efficiency—because Mr Verloc was good.  His mother and his sister had established that ethical fact on an unshakable foundation.  They had established, erected, consecrated it behind Mr Verloc’s back, for reasons that had nothing to do with abstract morality.  And Mr Verloc was not aware of it.  It is but bare justice to him to say that he had no notion of appearing good to Stevie.  Yet so it was.  He was even the only man so qualified in Stevie’s knowledge, because the gentlemen lodgers had been too transient and too remote to have anything very distinct about them but perhaps their boots; and as regards the disciplinary measures of his father, the desolation of his mother and sister shrank from setting up a theory of goodness before the victim.  It would have been too cruel.  And it was even possible that Stevie would not have believed them.  As far as Mr Verloc was concerned, nothing could stand in the way of Stevie’s belief.  Mr Verloc was obviously yet mysteriously good.  And the grief of a good man is august.

Stevie gave glances of reverential compassion to his brother-in-law.  Mr Verloc was sorry.  The brother of Winnie had never before felt himself in such close communion with the mystery of that man’s goodness.  It was an understandable sorrow.  And Stevie himself was sorry.  He was very sorry.  The same sort of sorrow.  And his attention being drawn to this unpleasant state, Stevie shuffled his feet.  His feelings were habitually manifested by the agitation of his limbs.

“Keep your feet quiet, dear,” said Mrs Verloc, with authority and tenderness; then turning towards her husband in an indifferent voice, the masterly achievement of instinctive tact: “Are you going out to-night?” she asked.

The mere suggestion seemed repugnant to Mr Verloc.  He shook his head moodily, and then sat still with downcast eyes, looking at the piece of cheese on his plate for a whole minute.  At the end of that time he got up, and went out—went right out in the clatter of the shop-door bell.  He acted thus inconsistently, not from any desire to make himself unpleasant, but because of an unconquerable restlessness.  It was no earthly good going out.  He could not find anywhere in London what he wanted.  But he went out.  He led a cortege of dismal thoughts along dark streets, through lighted streets, in and out of two flash bars, as if in a half-hearted attempt to make a night of it, and finally back again to his menaced home, where he sat down fatigued behind the counter, and they crowded urgently round him, like a pack of hungry black hounds.  After locking up the house and putting out the gas he took them upstairs with him—a dreadful escort for a man going to bed.  His wife had preceded him some time before, and with her ample form defined vaguely under the counterpane, her head on the pillow, and a hand under the cheek offered to his distraction the view of early drowsiness arguing the possession of an equable soul.  Her big eyes stared wide open, inert and dark against the snowy whiteness of the linen.  She did not move.

She had an equable soul.  She felt profoundly that things do not stand much looking into.  She made her force and her wisdom of that instinct.  But the taciturnity of Mr Verloc had been lying heavily upon her for a good many days.  It was, as a matter of fact, affecting her nerves.  Recumbent and motionless, she said placidly:

“You’ll catch cold walking about in your socks like this.”

This speech, becoming the solicitude of the wife and the prudence of the woman, took Mr Verloc unawares.  He had left his boots downstairs, but he had forgotten to put on his slippers, and he had been turning about the bedroom on noiseless pads like a bear in a cage.  At the sound of his wife’s voice he stopped and stared at her with a somnambulistic, expressionless gaze so long that Mrs Verloc moved her limbs slightly under the bed-clothes.  But she did not move her black head sunk in the white pillow one hand under her cheek and the big, dark, unwinking eyes.

Under her husband’s expressionless stare, and remembering her mother’s empty room across the landing, she felt an acute pang of loneliness.  She had never been parted from her mother before.  They had stood by each other.  She felt that they had, and she said to herself that now mother was gone—gone for good.  Mrs Verloc had no illusions.  Stevie remained, however.  And she said:

“Mother’s done what she wanted to do.  There’s no sense in it that I can see.  I’m sure she couldn’t have thought you had enough of her.  It’s perfectly wicked, leaving us like that.”

Mr Verloc was not a well-read person; his range of allusive phrases was limited, but there was a peculiar aptness in circumstances which made him think of rats leaving a doomed ship.  He very nearly said so.  He had grown suspicious and embittered.  Could it be that the old woman had such an excellent nose?  But the unreasonableness of such a suspicion was patent, and Mr Verloc held his tongue.  Not altogether, however.  He muttered heavily:

“Perhaps it’s just as well.”

He began to undress.  Mrs Verloc kept very still, perfectly still, with her eyes fixed in a dreamy, quiet stare.  And her heart for the fraction of a second seemed to stand still too.  That night she was “not quite herself,” as the saying is, and it was borne upon her with some force that a simple sentence may hold several diverse meanings—mostly disagreeable.  How was it just as well?  And why?  But she did not allow herself to fall into the idleness of barren speculation.  She was rather confirmed in her belief that things did not stand being looked into.  Practical and subtle in her way, she brought Stevie to the front without loss of time, because in her the singleness of purpose had the unerring nature and the force of an instinct.

“What I am going to do to cheer up that boy for the first few days I’m sure I don’t know.  He’ll be worrying himself from morning till night before he gets used to mother being away.  And he’s such a good boy.  I couldn’t do without him.”

Mr Verloc went on divesting himself of his clothing with the unnoticing inward concentration of a man undressing in the solitude of a vast and hopeless desert.  For thus inhospitably did this fair earth, our common inheritance, present itself to the mental vision of Mr Verloc.  All was so still without and within that the lonely ticking of the clock on the landing stole into the room as if for the sake of company.

Mr Verloc, getting into bed on his own side, remained prone and mute behind Mrs Verloc’s back.  His thick arms rested abandoned on the outside of the counterpane like dropped weapons, like discarded tools.  At that moment he was within a hair’s breadth of making a clean breast of it all to his wife.  The moment seemed propitious.  Looking out of the corners of his eyes, he saw her ample shoulders draped in white, the back of her head, with the hair done for the night in three plaits tied up with black tapes at the ends.  And he forbore.  Mr Verloc loved his wife as a wife should be loved—that is, maritally, with the regard one has for one’s chief possession.  This head arranged for the night, those ample shoulders, had an aspect of familiar sacredness—the sacredness of domestic peace.  She moved not, massive and shapeless like a recumbent statue in the rough; he remembered her wide-open eyes looking into the empty room.  She was mysterious, with the mysteriousness of living beings.  The far-famed secret agent [delta] of the late Baron Stott-Wartenheim’s alarmist despatches was not the man to break into such mysteries.  He was easily intimidated.  And he was also indolent, with the indolence which is so often the secret of good nature.  He forbore touching that mystery out of love, timidity, and indolence.  There would be always time enough.  For several minutes he bore his sufferings silently in the drowsy silence of the room.  And then he disturbed it by a resolute declaration.

“I am going on the Continent to-morrow.”

His wife might have fallen asleep already.  He could not tell.  As a matter of fact, Mrs Verloc had heard him.  Her eyes remained very wide open, and she lay very still, confirmed in her instinctive conviction that things don’t bear looking into very much.  And yet it was nothing very unusual for Mr Verloc to take such a trip.  He renewed his stock from Paris and Brussels.  Often he went over to make his purchases personally.  A little select connection of amateurs was forming around the shop in Brett Street, a secret connection eminently proper for any business undertaken by Mr Verloc, who, by a mystic accord of temperament and necessity, had been set apart to be a secret agent all his life.

He waited for a while, then added: “I’ll be away a week or perhaps a fortnight.  Get Mrs Neale to come for the day.”

Mrs Neale was the charwoman of Brett Street.  Victim of her marriage with a debauched joiner, she was oppressed by the needs of many infant children.  Red-armed, and aproned in coarse sacking up to the arm-pits, she exhaled the anguish of the poor in a breath of soap-suds and rum, in the uproar of scrubbing, in the clatter of tin pails.

Mrs Verloc, full of deep purpose, spoke in the tone of the shallowest indifference.

“There is no need to have the woman here all day.  I shall do very well with Stevie.”

She let the lonely clock on the landing count off fifteen ticks into the abyss of eternity, and asked:

“Shall I put the light out?”

Mr Verloc snapped at his wife huskily.

“Put it out.”",164620,en,en,en

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this

Killing time and just  lling air

Told by those Doubting Thomases

I eat eat eat rhymes, Niggas don't be understanding that shit
Why you think I went and put a fucking mic on my arm
Cause it belongs to me and I belong next to Ghengis Khan

Like Han Solo when he got frozen in Star Wars

[Verse Two]
Its legibly unimaginable, mathematically incalculable
Inextricably infallible
Let's not forget utterly impossible or
Morally insurmountable to assume that I could lose if I battled you
My Scholastic Aptitude is 1602
100 bars was just a glimpse of the truth
Physical proof that I'm the best at this
I've constructed sentences
That'll stand longer than Stonehenge's megaliths
My 1st and 2nd albums consist of more then a million terabits
More than any of you rappers ever spit
Vote for me as President, in about a day or so
I be up in the White House getting fellatio
By an administrative assistant with deep throat
Butt naked on the floor knee deep in some coke
Or on a speaker phone freestyling with some of my folks
Humping a ho tampering with the Republican vote
I'm like Mel Gibson in Braveheart, fighting swordsman
Dodging arrows from the arches cause I'm a Horseman
Flying circles around you like flying saucers
Flying circles around the royal air force's flying fortress
Maximize my wins, minimize my losses
'Til I'm exhausted then lounge like the lyricists on Rawkus
I'm unsigned right now, it's like I'm an orphan
Looking for a home taking all calls and offers
Notify the Prince and the Duke of Earl
I'm probably the illest English speaking MC in the world
Ghetto fabulous, verbally hazardous
Ask any Baptist, Roman Catholic or satanic activist
Even them trippy hippies on college campuses know about Canibus
I've got rhymes like beads on an abacus
My styles totally out the bracket
Scientist in thick glasses and pocket protectors want to patent it
My talent is unmatched by any rapper in this rapping biz
By any rapper on this planet's grid
Show me where he is, I sign the ordinance
To bomb his coordinates with Agent Orange and torture him
Burn the skin off of him, throw a towel on him and stomp on him
Rip the towel off then pour salt on him
Continue my verbal assault on him til its 12 in the morning
And turn into the werewolf monster on him
Rip his heart out, eat it while its still pumping
The blood still running, it tastes like boiled dumplings
Starving artist, I turned down scholarships to Oxford College
Cause I heard they didn't serve porridge
Smarter than any man in Scotland Yard is
Used to work for MI-6 but quit cause I couldn't take orders
I was the original James Bond before Sean Conn', Roger Moore
Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan
The most awesome walking, talking, breathing
English speaking MC in the European region
Rip you to pieces like Communism leaflets
Beef with 'Bis is like playing chess without the pieces
Modern Christians without Jesus, Rastas without reefer
Jamaicans in Princeton without visas
Radios without speakers, Mother Nature without the four seasons
Without a jacket outside when its freezing

His prints were on my pants
I coulda shot him, but I stabbed him
Heard him cry once
Heard him cry twice
Forty year old man, begging for his life
Goodnight

Waited till he got home
Looking through his windows
Saw he was all alone
Then I knocked at his home
Rang the doorbell, and I smiled at him
The fool was dumb enough to let me in

Sat on the couch and we talked about life
Ironic how soon he would want to end mine
Sunshine Christo going well, yeah it's going fine
You won’t be alive to see whole rise
To see the whole risе
Pushing all my buttons
Slowly getting madder, at that moment in timе
I realized it didn't matter
Premediated, but I'ma lose control
Three slashes and I’ve lost my soul
Felt the blade hit his flesh and cards began to fold
Held the knife sideways
Stabbing him like a deer on the highway
He was my prey, you can fucking pray but you can't be saved
Take one slash, not fast enough, not deep enough
Take another one, deeper and deeper
Right through his chest
Stab with such hatred, that you could tear through anything
His pulse went cold
His body's so warm
Looked in his eyes, they were wider than the sky
His blood was drenched in my knife
In my knife

Everything felt so quiet
I felt so numb
This the moment I've been waiting for and it's already done
Got up from the floor where I pinned him down
Laughed to myself, and then I left town

But you make me forget so very much
I forget to pray for the angels
And then the angels forget to pray for us

Deep in the green lilac park
You held on to me like I was a crucifix
As we went kneeling through the dark

To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

Your letters they all say that you're beside me now
Then why do I feel alone?
I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web
Is fastening my ankle to a stone

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

For now I need your hidden love
I'm cold as a new razor blade
You left when I told you I was curious
I never said that I was brave

To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

Oh, you are really such a pretty one
I see you've gone and changed your name again
And just when I climbed this whole mountainside
To wash my eyelids in the rain!

Joseph Andrews Chap. 2.12,misc,Henry Fielding,1742,14,{},"        A very delightful adventure, as well to the persons concerned as to the good-natured reader.

        Adams, Fanny, and the guide, set out together about one in the morning, the moon being then just risen. They had not gone above a mile before a most violent storm of rain obliged them to take shelter in an inn, or rather alehouse, where Adams immediately procured himself a good fire, a toast and ale, and a pipe, and began to smoke with great content, utterly forgetting everything that had happened.

        Fanny sat likewise down by the fire; but was much more impatient at the storm. She presently engaged the eyes of the host, his wife, the maid of the house, and the young fellow who was their guide; they all conceived they had never seen anything half so handsome; and indeed, reader, if thou art of an amorous hue, I advise thee to skip over the next paragraph; which, to render our history perfect, we are obliged to set down, humbly hoping that we may escape the fate of Pygmalion; for if it should happen to us, or to thee, to be struck with this picture, we should be perhaps in as helpless a condition as Narcissus, and might say to ourselves, Quod petis est nusquam. Or, if the finest features in it should set Lady ——'s image before our eyes, we should be still in as bad a situation, and might say to our desires, Coelum ipsum petimus stultitia.

        Fanny was now in the nineteenth year of her age; she was tall and delicately shaped; but not one of those slender young women who seem rather intended to hang up in the hall of an anatomist than for any other purpose. On the contrary, she was so plump that she seemed bursting through her tight stays, especially in the part which confined her swelling breasts. Nor did her hips want the assistance of a hoop to extend them. The exact shape of her arms denoted the form of those limbs which she concealed; and though they were a little reddened by her labour, yet, if her sleeve slipped above her elbow, or her handkerchief discovered any part of her neck, a whiteness appeared which the finest Italian paint would be unable to reach. Her hair was of a chesnut brown, and nature had been extremely lavish to her of it, which she had cut, and on Sundays used to curl down her neck, in the modern fashion. Her forehead was high, her eyebrows arched, and rather full than otherwise. Her eyes black and sparkling; her nose just inclining to the Roman; her lips red and moist, and her underlip, according to the opinion of the ladies, too pouting. Her teeth were white, but not exactly even. The small-pox had left one only mark on her chin, which was so large, it might have been mistaken for a dimple, had not her left cheek produced one so near a neighbour to it, that the former served only for a foil to the latter. Her complexion was fair, a little injured by the sun, but overspread with such a bloom that the finest ladies would have exchanged all their white for it: add to these a countenance in which, though she was extremely bashful, a sensibility appeared almost incredible; and a sweetness, whenever she smiled, beyond either imitation or description. To conclude all, she had a natural gentility, superior to the acquisition of art, and which surprized all who beheld her.

        This lovely creature was sitting by the fire with Adams, when her attention was suddenly engaged by a voice from an inner room, which sung the following song:—

         THE SONG.
Say, Chloe, where must the swain stray
         Who is by thy beauties undone?
To wash their remembrance away,
         To what distant Lethe must run?
The wretch who is sentenced to die
         May escape, and leave justice behind;
From his country perhaps he may fly,
         But oh! can he fly from his mind?

O rapture! unthought of before,
         To be thus of Chloe possess'd;
Nor she, nor no tyrant's hard power,
         Her image can tear from my breast.
But felt not Narcissus more joy,
         With his eyes he beheld his loved charms?
Yet what he beheld the fond boy
         More eagerly wish'd in his arms.
How can it thy dear image be
         Which fills thus my bosom with woe?
Can aught bear resemblance to thee
         Which grief and not joy can bestow?
This counterfeit snatch from my heart,
         Ye pow'rs, tho' with torment I rave,
Tho' mortal will prove the fell smart:
         I then shall find rest in my grave.

Ah, see the dear nymph o'er the plain
         Come smiling and tripping along!
A thousand Loves dance in her train,
         The Graces around her all throng.
To meet her soft Zephyrus flies,
         And wafts all the sweets from the flowers,
Ah, rogue I whilst he kisses her eyes,
         More sweets from her breath he devours.

My soul, whilst I gaze, is on fire:
         But her looks were so tender and kind,
My hope almost reach'd my desire,
         And left lame despair far behind.
Transported with madness, I flew,
         And eagerly seized on my bliss;
Her bosom but half she withdrew,
         But half she refused my fond kiss.
Advances like these made me bold;
         I whisper'd her—Love, we're alone.—
The rest let immortals unfold;
         No language can tell but their own.
Ah, Chloe, expiring, I cried,
         How long I thy cruelty bore!
Ah, Strephon, she blushing replied,
         You ne'er was so pressing before.

        Adams had been ruminating all this time on a passage in Aeschylus, without attending in the least to the voice, though one of the most melodious that ever was heard, when, casting his eyes on Fanny, he cried out, ""Bless us, you look extremely pale!""—""Pale! Mr Adams,"" says she; ""O Jesus!"" and fell backwards in her chair. Adams jumped up, flung his Aeschylus into the fire, and fell a-roaring to the people of the house for help. He soon summoned every one into the room, and the songster among the rest; but, O reader! when this nightingale, who was no other than Joseph Andrews himself, saw his beloved Fanny in the situation we have described her, canst thou conceive the agitations of his mind? If thou canst not, waive that meditation to behold his happiness, when, clasping her in his arms, he found life and blood returning into her cheeks: when he saw her open her beloved eyes, and heard her with the softest accent whisper, ""Are you Joseph Andrews?""—""Art thou my Fanny?"" he answered eagerly: and, pulling her to his heart, he imprinted numberless kisses on her lips, without considering who were present.

        If prudes are offended at the lusciousness of this picture, they may take their eyes off from it, and survey parson Adams dancing about the room in a rapture of joy. Some philosophers may perhaps doubt whether he was not the happiest of the three: for the goodness of his heart enjoyed the blessings which were exulting in the breasts of both the other two, together with his own. But we shall leave such disquisitions, as too deep for us, to those who are building some favourite hypothesis, which they will refuse no metaphysical rubbish to erect and support: for our part, we give it clearly on the side of Joseph, whose happiness was not only greater than the parson's, but of longer duration: for as soon as the first tumults of Adams's rapture were over he cast his eyes towards the fire, where Aeschylus lay expiring; and immediately rescued the poor remains, to wit, the sheepskin covering, of his dear friend, which was the work of his own hands, and had been his inseparable companion for upwards of thirty years.

        Fanny had no sooner perfectly recovered herself than she began to restrain the impetuosity of her transports; and, reflecting on what she had done and suffered in the presence of so many, she was immediately covered with confusion; and, pushing Joseph gently from her, she begged him to be quiet, nor would admit of either kiss or embrace any longer. Then, seeing Mrs Slipslop, she curtsied, and offered to advance to her; but that high woman would not return her curtsies; but, casting her eyes another way, immediately withdrew into another room, muttering, as she went, she wondered who the creature was.",137498,en,en,en

day being intensely hot, and the sun shining in its strength, the
Traveler stopped to rest, and sought shelter from the heat under
the Shadow of the Ass. As this afforded only protection for one,
and as the Traveler and the owner of the Ass both claimed it, a
violent dispute arose between them as to which of them had the
right to the Shadow. The owner maintained that he had let the
Ass only, and not his Shadow. The Traveler asserted that he had,
with the hire of the Ass, hired his Shadow also. The quarrel
proceeded from words to blows, and while the men fought, the Ass
galloped off.

The Rippler,rap,Raaghov,2018,436,{},"[Verse 1]
I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Damn, life just chewed me up and threw me up into a future
In which I'm soon to be informed that I'm useless
'Cause life is just a movie but I was cast for the bloopers
Man, I'm losing motivation
Everybody's in school and I'm over here skipping days, and
Saving myself from stress, my house became a haven
I got folks calling me during class on several occasions
Just to tell me that they love me, but I pushed that away 'cause
I didn't wanna drag 'em down if I started straying away from expectations
Disappointing them's what I'm afraid of
Or maybe it's the pain that shakes me just to make me wake up
But what pain have I seen? I'm just a stupid teen
I ain't lived more than 2 decades but still, my heart stings
And still, my heart strings are plucked, and my heart sings for love
From the crowd, from myself, from above
An audience of 7 billion: I try not to fear 'em
But the toughest critic of all resides inside my cerebrum
I feel him eating at my confidence and thriving on my fear of
Not recognizing the man looking back from inside the mirror at me
[Hook]
Gaze lowered, tearing up, on my face a frown
As I caught my own reflection in the puddles on the ground
I get so deep into it, start to feel like I could drown
I shed a tear thinking 'bout how life's got me down
It drops on my reflection, sending ripples all around
Ripples that spoke volumes but ain't even make a sound
'Cause like the waves spread and bend reflections that surround
I discovered my pain ain't subtle; it ripples through the crowd

[Verse 2]
Days roll slowly, but years are bolting by
Years of watching peers fly, and years of hoping I
Could catch a gust of wind and one day float in open sky
Until I find I couldn't jump, I'm scared to death to die
Don't wanna fall behind, so I push my fears aside
I spread my wings out wide, and I flap a couple times
I'm taking longer strides, adrenaline pumping, I'm 'bout to dive
But right before I take that leap of faith, I stumble on my pride
I plummet down to earth, with reality, I collide
As my aspirations subside, disappointment persuades my mind that
I'm dreaming pipe dreams, and I'm leading a life of lies
I think my wings aren't strong enough to hold these ambitions of mine
I had dreams of getting signed one day
To be the first brown kid with his name in the hall of fame of hip-hop
School was just a pit stop in a bigger race
At least, I treated it that way, but that became my mistake
And down went my grades along with my whole mental state
Due to the fact that I never had my priorities straight
Focused on current tastes, but never considered my future state
My louche behavior and rakish nature led me to move astray
[Hook]
Gaze lowered, tearing up, on my face a frown
As I caught my own reflection in the puddles on the ground
I get so deep into it, start to feel like I could drown
I shed a tear thinking 'bout how life's got me down
It drops on my reflection, sending ripples all around
Ripples that spoke volumes but ain't even make a sound
'Cause like the waves spread and bend reflections that surround
I discovered my pain ain't subtle; it ripples through the crowd

[Verse 3]
As I ruminated, I was called by my man from school to hang, and
I was hesitant 'cause at the time I swam in pools of hatred
Parasitic mindset, but maybe some plans could fumigate it
Never thought that I'd be 100% rejuvenated
He dapped me up and asked how I'd been doing lately
I replied, ""still tryna find myself, dude, it's crazy""
He just laughed and said, ""that shit was deep but dated""
Half-laughing back, I said, ""for real, it's a bad path I'm paving""
Must've seen I was jaded 'cause slowly his smile faded
With a look of pain he asked me what I meant by that statement
I said, ""fuck it,"" and told him these same words I'm conveying
That I'm praying maybe there's still a chance of me graduating
That the pain of not being able to achieve any greatness
Was weighing down my sense of self, rendered helpless, I felt like caving
Like taking a blade to the chest, engraving my heart with a ""Rest
In Peace,"" admittedly, it seemed death is my destiny
There was a silence, I waited for him to break it
He was gazing into space, his mouth agape, visibly shaken
Then he looked at me and said, ""you know what's really frustrating?
Taking my story and yours and comparing situations
Here's why: A few years back I found out my life was in danger
Only way to be saved was through surgical operations
The prospect that I could die took over, but I had to face it
So I found within me a silver of hope and I maintained it
And if not for that mindset, we would not be here exchanging
Heart-to-hearts and pains for pains, but what I really fuckin' hate is
The fact that a dude like you with dope passions and thoughts unmatched
After a couple steps back, would begin to give up on that
Listen, you've affected every soul in our class
Not hyperbolically, the positive impact you have is vast
So at times when you lose control and feel like you're 'bout to crash
Recall that you've helped us all and use that to get back on track.""
That night I lay awake, soul aching
Brain breaking down the frame of what my main man was saying
Tears came to my eyes when I finally realized
That the more I pain, the more my friends are aching
So I made a promise to myself and those on whom I can count
I'd be as strong as I could be whenever pain is in town
Would die for my friends, but I live for 'em, it's just crazy how
One conversation can turn your whole damn existence around

We crowd and begin to look down
To see you embedded without a thorn crown. Are we disfigured in these eyes?
Are we the ones that create such stutter?
How do we awaken a beast, when all we have is one last wish?

Bitterly have I rued my meanness

     And there was the likeness—yes, my own!
Taken when I was the season's fairest,
        And time-lines all unknown.

     I smiled at my image, and put it back,
     And he went on cherishing it, until
I was chafed that he loved not the me then living,
        But that past woman still.

Left a thottie in a trance

Coz she stepped on my vans
I don't care how good you dance
When we're alone keep your pants, on
What you stepping on my vans, for
Pair cost a couple grands
And you ain't even got the Rands
You should blow me like a fan
Only way to pay me back

But first take a sip, and then swallow the kids, what?

It, my kicks on Van Damme
Hit Pebbles with long club feeling like I'm Bamm Bamm
I'ma make her bed rock in front of her damn fam
Hit it like a drum, bedroom sounding like a band camp

But she won't get promoted coz 3T be the coldest

We up 3 in the morn, going in
My kids dipped in your pool and they gon swim
Now they racing, I wonder who's gon win
Never had to face this shit with lotion
So to cope I stay sipping a potion
That's potent, I'm gripping the bottle with both hands
And hoping it won't end, dropping songs and just hoping they gon trend
See the fact a blesser's just gon spend
On your bitch if she loose or she broken

Here to bring you that fire, hadouken
If they fake I ain't fucking with those friends
Piss in the pool full of liquor they soak in
My squad ain't the one to be provoking
My face straight do I look like I'm joking?
I done came up, met a girl I couldn't pass
High maintenance coz she got class
She had me thinking Uber whack
Had to cop an Uber black
And send her back to her mans
Then I met him, hit the stance
Made the nigga catch these hands
Coz he stepped in my vans
And that nigga heavy, (ouch)
My Nina stay wet, she's ready
I keep an eye on her, Fetty

And you'll make the cut like machete

[?]: I've got a question

[Hook: Akrobatik and Mr. Lif]
Where are the weapons of mass destruction?
We’ve been looking for months and we ain’t found nothing
Please, Mr. President, tell us something
We knew from the beginning that your ass was bluffing

[Verse 1: Mr. Lif]
How unfortunate.  It wasn't what you thought it, kid.  In basic training
They taught you how to slay men as a starter kit
And you showed up with a gun to load up, hoping a college
Education's waiting, maybe a steady occupation
Now you weighing many lives against yours.  President’s wars
Got you on course with holocaust.  Sergeant is lost
General's boss.  Plans cross, now you in the crosshair
Of a sniper, shaky, scared, shot off your ear
Old, fucked up, down.  One round just hit him and it’s
From some young, yet expendable citizen
He's from the other side of the line, fighting for time
Time to see his kids walk, time to talk with his pa
Time to have a rational thought without the fear of being shot
Damn, his gun jammed.  Now you’ve got to bombard
It's a soldier's suicide slide.  Know you tried hard
To stay alive when you're catching fire from both sides
And we miss you at home.  It’s time the government truly left
You alone, dropped you off and popped one in your dome
Now we've seen it in Iraq and the Congo.  America's
Motto: kill their leader, then we make a stronghold

Where are the weapons of mass destruction?
We’ve been looking for months and we ain’t found nothing
Please, Mr. President, tell us something
We knew from the beginning that your ass was bluffing

[Verse 2: Akrobatik]
I never thought of this the day that I enlisted: that I'd be dodging
Bullets, seeking weapons that never even existed
For someone else's personal beef, I’ll risk my health
While the commander-in-chief would never come and fight himself
I feel I'm being tricked even worse that the civilians
Nobody ever told me that we would be killing children
Feeling like the ones that sent me here are the psychotics
But if I say that out loud, I'm ""unpatriotic""
But would Donald Rumsfeld back me up with the chrome?
Would Tom Ridge fight or would he stay secure back home?
And would Condoleezza Rice cover grenades in the foxhole?
I'm starting to believe what I was told is not so
What's the reason for the war?  I'm shooting
At these people that I got no animosity for
I wonder if I'm just a pawn in someone else's struggle
Or a hero even though I'm such a small piece of the puzzle
I know that when I finally return where I reside
I'll make up for the months my wife and moms cried
And carry on for all my fallen brothers who died
See, you can't take my pride ‘cause I'm a fucking soldier

Wish life had a partition cause I know God seeing my sinning

I would even pay penitence
Cause I wanna get paid off my pen and shit
Still penniless, moved to New York
That was my penance cause

Where do you go when nothing is marked?

It ain’t my style having someone on me
Saying how much money I need to shell out while I’m going hungry
I heard a story about
An older lady who wanted to dial
Getting a blessing, one of them prayer towels
Pastor got on camera told the crowd he wasn’t down
Cause that lady ain’t been to church in a while
He said that she should have faith
Even if the city is shut down
Pay her tithes, fuck a mask and get back to the church now
That shit was wild

Alone on hell she rides
Lichen, undead and rotten
Dripping and dignified

She combs with violence
Upon the wailing storm
This spectral ship of doomed purgation barrels on awry

On stirring seas of salted blood
Condemned to forge her sails forevermore
Enslaved, her hull will never reach the shores
Damning these waters of irony filth

Beneath the stench of crimson winds
Her sails of flesh betorn
Red skeletons are oaring
The plasma stains their bones

Her rusting cannons fire blindly in the mist
This haunted vessel lost and damned
The prisoners of her endless quest
A burial at ancient sea
That cannot rest in fucking peace

The crew of wraith-like revenants
Merely seek peace and reverence
From purgatorial permanence
Their cursed bondage has no end!

On they ride
Through the throes of endless night
Her will never dies!

The compass pointing straight to hell
And that is where they're going
Beaten by curling waves of red
The storm, no signs of slowing now

Damning these waters of irony filth
Scabbed with the blood of the ones they have killed

Little Yellow Bird,pop,Angela Lansbury,2020,1002,{},"(Verse 1)
The snow was very plentiful
And clouds were very few
When a weather-beaten sparrow
Through a mansion window flew
Her eye fell on a golden cage
A sweet love song she heard
Sung by a pet canary there
A handsome yellow bird
He said to her, ""Miss Sparrow
I've been struck by Cupid's arrow
Would you share my cage with me?""
She looked up at his castle
With its ribbon and its tassel
And in plaintive tones said she:

(Chorus 1)
""Good-byе, little yellow bird
I'd rather bravе the cold
On a leafless tree
Than a prisoner be
In a cage of gold.""
(Verse 2)
The spoiled and petted yellow bird
Could scarce believe it true
That a common sparrow should refuse
A bird with blood so blue
He told her the advantages
Of riches and of gold
She answered that her liberties
For gold could not be sold
She said ""I must be going.""
But he cried ""No, no, its snowing
And the wintry winds do blow
Stay with me, my little dearie
For without you 'twould be dreary.""
But she only sighed ""Ah, no.""

(Chorus 2)
""Good-bye, little yellow bird
I'd gladly mate with you -
I love you, little yellow bird
But I love my freedom, too

Something About the Kannakippers,misc,Herman Melville,1847,4,{},"A worthy young man, formerly a friend of mine (I speak of Kooloo with all possible courtesy, since after our intimacy there would be an impropriety in doing otherwise)—this worthy youth, having some genteel notions of retirement, dwelt in a ""maroo boro,"" or bread-fruit shade, a pretty nook in a wood, midway between the Calabooza Beretanee and the Church of Cocoa-nuts. Hence, at the latter place, he was one of the most regular worshippers.

Kooloo was a blade. Standing up in the congregation in all the bravеry of a striped calico shirt, with the skirts rakishly adjusted ovеr a pair of white sailor trousers, and hair well anointed with cocoa-nut oil, he ogled the ladies with an air of supreme satisfaction. Nor were his glances unreturned.

But such looks as the Tahitian belles cast at each other: frequently turning up their noses at the advent of a new cotton mantle recently imported in the chest of some amorous sailor. Upon one occasion, I observed a group of young girls, in tunics of course, soiled sheeting, disdainfully pointing at a damsel in a flaming red one. ""Oee tootai owree!"" said they with ineffable scorn, ""itai maitai!"" (You are a good-for-nothing huzzy, no better than you should be).

Now, Kooloo communed with the church; so did all these censorious young ladies. Yet after eating bread-fruit at the Eucharist, I knew several of them, the same night, to be guilty of some sad derelictions.

Puzzled by these things, I resolved to find out, if possible, what ideas, if any, they entertained of religion; but as one's spiritual concerns are rather delicate for a stranger to meddle with, I went to work as adroitly as I could.

Farnow, an old native who had recently retired from active pursuits, having thrown up the business of being a sort of running footman to the queen, had settled down in a snug little retreat, not fifty rods from Captain Bob's. His selecting our vicinity for his residence may have been with some view to the advantages it afforded for introducing his three daughters into polite circles. At any rate, not averse to receiving the attentions of so devoted a gallant as the doctor, the sisters (communicants, be it remembered) kindly extended to him free permission to visit them sociably whenever he pleased.

We dropped in one evening, and found the ladies at home. My long friend engaged his favourites, the two younger girls, at the game of ""Now,"" or hunting a stone under three piles of tappa. For myself, I lounged on a mat with Ideea the eldest, dallying with her grass fan, and improving my knowledge of Tahitian.

The occasion was well adapted to my purpose, and I began.

""Ah, Ideea, mickonaree oee?"" the same as drawling out—""By the bye, Miss Ideea, do you belong to the church?""

""Yes, me mickonaree,"" was the reply.

But the assertion was at once qualified by certain, reservations; so curious that I cannot forbear their relation.
""Mickonaree ena"" (church member here), exclaimed she, laying her hand upon her mouth, and a strong emphasis on the adverb. In the same way, and with similar exclamations, she touched her eyes and hands. This done, her whole air changed in an instant; and she gave me to understand, by unmistakable gestures, that in certain other respects she was not exactly a ""mickonaree."" In short, Ideea was

""A sad good Christian at the heart—A very heathen in the carnal part.""

The explanation terminated in a burst of laughter, in which all three sisters joined; and for fear of looking silly, the doctor and myself. As soon as good-breeding would permit, we took leave.

The hypocrisy in matters of religion, so apparent in all Polynesian converts, is most injudiciously nourished in Tahiti by a zealous and in many cases, a coercive superintendence over their spiritual well-being. But it is only manifested with respect to the common people, their superiors being exempted.

On Sunday mornings, when the prospect is rather small for a full house in the minor churches, a parcel of fellows are actually sent out with ratans into the highways and byways as whippers-in of the congregation. This is a sober fact.

These worthies constitute a religious police; and you always know them by the great white diapers they wear. On week days they are quite as busy as on Sundays; to the great terror of the inhabitants, going all over the island, and spying out the wickedness thereof.

Moreover, they are the collectors of fines—levied generally in grass mats—for obstinate non-attendance upon divine worship, and other offences amenable to the ecclesiastical judicature of the missionaries.

Old Bob called these fellows ""kannakippers"" a corruption, I fancy, of our word constable.

He bore them a bitter grudge; and one day, drawing near home, and learning that two of them were just then making a domiciliary visit at his house, he ran behind a bush; and as they came forth, two green bread-fruit from a hand unseen took them each between the shoulders. The sailors in the Calabooza were witnesses to this, as well as several natives; who, when the intruders were out of sight, applauded Captain Bob's spirit in no measured terms; the ladies present vehemently joining in. Indeed, the kannakippers have no greater enemies than the latter. And no wonder: the impertinent varlets, popping into their houses at all hours, are forever prying into their peccadilloes.

Kooloo, who at times was patriotic and pensive, and mourned the evils under which his country was groaning, frequently inveighed against the statute which thus authorized an utter stranger to interfere with domestic arrangements. He himself—quite a ladies' man—had often been annoyed thereby. He considered the kannakippers a bore.

Beside their confounded inquisitiveness, they add insult to injury, by making a point of dining out every day at some hut within the limits of their jurisdiction. As for the gentleman of the house, his meek endurance of these things is amazing. But ""good easy man,"" there is nothing for him but to be as hospitable as possible.

These gentry are indefatigable. At the dead of night prowling round the houses, and in the daytime hunting amorous couples in the groves. Yet in one instance the chase completely baffled them.

It was thus.
Several weeks previous to our arrival at the island, someone's husband and another person's wife, having taken a mutual fancy for each other, went out for a walk. The alarm was raised, and with hue and cry they were pursued; but nothing was seen of them again until the lapse of some ninety days; when we were called out from the Calabooza to behold a great mob inclosing the lovers, and escorting them for trial to the village.

Their appearance was most singular. The girdle excepted, they were quite naked; their hair was long, burned yellow at the ends, and entangled with burrs; and their bodies scratched and scarred in all directions. It seems that, acting upon the ""love in a cottage"" principle, they had gone right into the interior; and throwing up a hut in an uninhabited valley, had lived there, until in an unlucky stroll they were observed and captured.

They were subsequently condemned to make one hundred fathoms of Broom Road—a six months' work, if not more.

Often, when seated in a house, conversing quietly with its inmates, I have known them betray the greatest confusion at the sudden announcement of a kannakipper's being in sight. To be reported by one of these officials as a ""Tootai Owree"" (in general, signifying a bad person or disbeliever in Christianity), is as much dreaded as the forefinger of Titus Gates was, levelled at an alleged papist.

But the islanders take a sly revenge upon them. Upon entering a dwelling, the kannakippers oftentimes volunteer a pharisaical prayer-meeting: hence, they go in secret by the name of ""Boora-Artuas,"" literally, ""Pray-to-Gods.""",6636816,en,en,en

This the life of Payroll Giovanni
I make my own rules, I don’t follow nobody (Yuh)
I run with a cocaine group like Yo Gotti (Yeah)
Off-set rims on the coupe, the wife shotty
Whoa Kemosabe, gettin' froze is a hobby
All the floors get the load in the hotel lobby
Paid every tab, boy, my credit is flawless (Boy)
When I get to work, I swear, it feel like an auction
I hustle like Nip, yeah, shout out to Slauson
Blow dealer like George, yeah, shout out to Boston (What up though?)
You got your first pack, and you started to stallin'
I came across crack, then I started to ballin'
Shout out to my grand-daddy, he was a king pin (Gang Gang)
He put me on game, had me ballin' on weekends (Yeah)
Showed my granny nine O's, I got these in (Look)
She looked at me with worry, like ""You now in the deep end""
[Chorus]
My life? Where do I begin?
Hand-in-hand rocks, tryna come up on ten (Yuh)

S550 valet-parked by the Range (Yuh)
My life? Big crib, chandeliers
Shed champagne-tears for my niggas that ain't here

[Verse 2]
I hear money counters in my dreams, nightmares of triple beams
We used to pass town, crackin' jokes with the fiends (Haha)
Now, I spend G’s on some normal ass jeans
Off the scene in European clothes and cars on the scene (There go Pay)
When I had the bows, you ain't have a clue (Why?)
'Cause you a outsider, we don’t fuck with you (Fuck with you)
You was stealin' bikes, I was dealin' white (White)
Half these niggas never balled in they fuckin' life (Never)
But all on the 'net, talkin' heavy
I just left Goon's son, put baguettes in the Presi-
Boogers in the ‘Piece, gave my cook [?]
Now, my workers posted up, like a hooker in the street (Post)
Might see us in the club, poppin' Dom, wearin' minks
No charm on the chain, but it's forty for the link (Forty)
Bosses at my table, nigga, you can't have a seat
Used to play the game deep, now I need hills where I sleep, nigga

Slick execution from musics perennial delinquent French Version,misc,The Guardian,2014,90,"{Eminem,""Harriet Gibsone""}","Eminem has become the first rapper to perform a headline show at Wembley Stadium

""I see a lot of people who appear to be fucking wasted – how many people here are fucking wasted? And how many people are here are just fucked up mentally?"" calls Eminem, introducing My Name Is, the anthem of every angry adolescent on the planet.

It's met with a feral roar from his army of fans, adorned in a uniform of Parental Advisory T-shirts, foam middle fingers or V For Vendetta masks.

You can see why this crowd of largely febrile young men welcome him back to the stage like an army of internet trolls blessed by the presence of their maker: Eminem is the first rapper to headline Wembley Stadium – and yet by his own admission, he's only here because Hyde Park deemed his lyrical content too offensive.

For music's perennial delinquent – now aged 41 – tonight is the first of two shows at the 90,000 capacity venue, and is the first time the Detroit artist has played the city since 2001 – a set that was then threatened by gay and women's rights protesters before the rapper sparked further controversy with the performance itself, as he took the stage replete with chainsaw, Friday the 13th hockey mask and, perhaps the most cardinal sin of all, wearing nothing but a pair of loosely fitting denim dungarees.
This time, however, the goal is to establish himself as one of music's most iconic artists, rather than shock the masses.

In those 13 years Eminem has encountered all manner of wrinkle inducing incidents – family lawsuits, overdoses and subsequent stints in rehabilitation and now sobriety – but he still cuts a striking figure. His arms are big but his face is thin and remains hidden by a black cap throughout the show, with his bleached blond hair barely visible.
He rattles through the first half of the set as if reacquainting himself with the stage, and it's not until he brings on surprise guest Dr Dre halfway through the show for Next Episode, Still Dre, G Thang and Forgot About Dre, that Eminem's ambitions become fully realised - even if Dre's voice is a much more almighty force than his apprentice's.

Despite his budget stretching to snag the richest rapper of all time, unfortunately there was no sign of Dido for Stan tonight, her part as an ill-fated pregnant girlfriend instead played by a glamorous backing vocalist in a leotard.

Some of Eminem's vision is executed brilliantly – after all, he's been making stadium rap albums since 2002. Tracks like Survival befit its location with its poodle perm guitars, and the Beastie Boys-indebted Berzerk sounds incredible live. Sing for the Moment and Toy Soldiers are huge crowd-pleasers, but then they were always built for arenas – to fill them, maybe, but not necessarily satisfy.

When it works, Eminem's music fills the space with a dark, rumbling magic – The Way I Am and his medley of My Name Is, Real Slim Shady and Without Me hits the balance of huge and yet intimately evil – but the flat points during the show come from a lack of menace, of spite, that same sinisterness that first gained him his loyal tribe, and made him so exciting.

Had me sitting in a hospital ward unable to speak
Like ""how the fuck did this happen!?""
Can't believe it's true
Telling me I couldn't spit was the deepest news (not a word)
I went vocal rehab for 6 whole months
And the worst part is I couldn't speak for two (not even)
No progression got my senses cloudy
Watching Dusty go sets without me
And everybody's telling me to get well soon
But I know deep down in their hearts they doubt me
Cah they ain't ever seen me at a level where I'm on form
Iron with the mic I could rock jaws, pussy you don't want war
Friends like this, dyu need opps for?
Cutting out tumours its surgery time
The TL went mad for Hell in a Cell
But to me it was coming nursery rhymes (playgroung ting)
J-mal vs Skem was 2010
At sixteen my 16's could murder these guys
(hahaha)
When there's favours involved man act like they're family (yeah)
Say they gon' bring me to this or bring me to that
But guess what? man never brang me
Said he'd ring when he was outside
Guess he never arrived cos man never brang me
All these broken promises is the reason why I'm moving anti
I'm angry
So don't tell me to get settled (nah)
Summon a spiritual flow and dead devils
Half these man just slept on the king
Cos they thought I was going in on Next Level
That was lightwork freestyled in my room
Cos I just wanted to catch a little vibe on a tune (bubbly bubbly)
No canon just filler, still quentin miller
It's straight headtops if I write for a yute (yeah)
Cah I am the grimey-est kid on this earth (yeah)
Fuck using a shilank I'll kill them with words
Man know what its worth, these hooks and punches
Be coming like bare fist fights on the curb
And my man he's swag puttin lies in his verse
We all know there's no truth to ya lines (not one)
Waste money on everything but production
That's why you ain't got a future in grime (it's mad)
Cos the way half these MCs move man it bugs me (it's mad)
Got money for yak and packs on their snap (yeah)
But nothing for a mix man its fuckree
Pink note on a vid and expecting a movie
Don't try tell me your hungry
With vids I only work with the kings
And Kirx won't come out his yard for less than a Monkey
And that's when it hit me (yeah)
Everyone in the grime scene wah act like they're brass (it's mad)
But they're in VIP with a yat (truss)
These man are not brass these man are just stinjy
Like ""my friends friend will film it for free
He can fly to the endz now he's gon' shoot me""
But why the fuck would I call in a favour
When I can pay Kirx and make me a movie (why would I?)
Couple cameraman I can't stand (nah)
Really out here claiming they're making bags (nah)
But take people money n ting
But don't finish the vids yeah that's shits all mad
Been back stage, with a couple big names
And all of a sudden you think you're bad? (come on)
But one of these days, your little games
Will end with a young g getting you stabbed
You'll bleed out and no-one will back it (no-one)
Cos the state of this whole scenes tragic (tragic)
No-ones savage, all whining and bitching
But they all claim they're on the roadside banging (liars)
And I don't know who did this
Or who's to blame but its so ridiculous
I tried to keep this shit to my self
But my body just moved by itself that's Ultra Instinct

Everybody is liars and everybody got teams

Tend to sleep right next to the bible when i'm awaking

Took some time out, did some soul searching, and found myself
Took me a while and this rap shit to really help
And I appreciate the drama and the love
Cause at the end of the day it's only building up my buzz
I ain't never looking down cause I won't face defeat
And all my quotes are valuable because I barely tweet
Nothing was giving or handed and I won't take it for granted
Because these streets will leave you starving and I gotta eat
You see my life's a mess, that's why I constantly stress
Waking up and visualizing satan
Aiming for the best and I won't settle nothing less

Falls and Right,rock,Grabak,1999,2,{},"Once upon the time I was the mightiest seraphim
I brought the light and justice in the name of god
All of the cherubs respected me for being the prince
Until the creation of his son I've been the highest archangel
Now this bastard shall be god's right hand
And propagate his will

So I fell for the first time from god's grace
To become one of a myriad nameless cherubs
During this time a new child grew up in me
Her name is hate

Together with like-minded cherubs I planned the rebellion
To overthrow the throne of god

But the divine weapons were more successful...

I find myself lying in an ocean of fire
My wings are burned by hungry flames
After the clash between the mightiest legions
And the heavenly throne I fell for a second time
But now into the glowing nothingness
My feet are bound in chains of burning iron
The darkest infernal leaders share my fate

Ashamed of the defeat
I ram my sword into the black stone
And scream for revenge
""You might have won a clash but not the war!!!""

My rage's echo reaches the halls of god
""One day I'll spread my wings and rise again!!!""
The upcoming battle against the divine archangels
Will mean their ultimate downfall

I unite my legions again
The black angels swords are raised
Myriad eyes of embattled seraphim and cherubs
Once fallen and enslaved, are waiting for my sign

A second time the weapons will strike to end the dominion of heaven
Mountains will be displaced

Worlds built in aeons are to be destroyed in one moment
With our new weapons we will bring the lightworld's end
The unbearable allmight of god and his son I'll stop with my scythe
Then their impaled heads will decorate my pandaemonium
The archangel's wings will be the ornaments of my coat of arms
And my name will shake the worlds again

Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide;
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me

[Verse 2]
Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see-
O Thou who changest not, abide with me

[Verse 3]
I need Thy presence every passing hour;
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'r?
Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me

[Verse 4]
I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness;
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me
[Verse 5]
Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies;
Heav'n's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me",5019604,en,en,en

Welcome to California
Remix! Remix! Remix! Remix! Remix!

[Mack 10 talking]
Uh, West Coast, Mack 10, Sly Boogy and the rest of the homies
Look..

[Verse 1: Mack 10]
See I was raised at the gutter
And no matter what happened I got that raw cane & water
I ain't dependin' on rappin'
And I ain't wit the disrespect, watch ya mouth when ya yappin'
I grab the homies and some bullies, hit ya block and start slappin'
And I got so much aqua, my traps got floods on it
Gettin' that rubber band money and who cares if Bloods is on it?
Mack 10, one of the few West Coasters to shine
And most of them got the mainstream, the hood is mine

[Verse 2: Jayo Felony]
Man, I'm quick to tell a killer that I'm iller than he is
See, and I'm a G since it's me and my peeps, please
Look I'm the quickest no stitches, hit switches
And I love these witches that be gobblin' snobbishness
We takin' wrist watches, we be plottin' on change main
Why did I hit you up? Homie this is the gang thang
Can't hang with us gorillas, you just an orangutan
Sly and Bullet Loco gone bring these killers PAIN!
[Verse 3: Sly Boogy]
Right, alright, hold up, trip (ha ha!)
Me and my niggas came to blow up shit (yeeah)
And show these niggas how to flow that spit (yeeah)
And quit actin' like some hoe-ass tricks (Sly Boogy!)
Fool, you know who the hell it is (yeeah)
I'm clickin' up wit all my cousins and relatives
And you could roll wit us and rep yo' block
And we could show these motherfuckers how the West Coast rock!
So come on

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy, Truth Hurts] + (Sly Boogy)
Everybody all around the world (yeah)
All the little baby boys and girls (alright)
Can't sleep cause they wanna know what's goin' on in California!
All the seeds all across the globe
People comin' from coast to coast
For the show cause they wanna know what's goin' on in California!

[Verse 4: E-40]
Talk to me, I talk back, ain't no need to explain
Y'all know my name
Y'all know who this is rappin' over this steel trap
Y'all know it's the man wit the slang
Use no pedal when pushin' that cane
Everything that I ever sold in the street it was top grade
Magazines, three mics, sprinkle truth in the game, spit the venom
Every rapper got a little E-40 up in em
Every rapper off the heezy fo' sheezy
I thought you plot em wit Jigga down
For shit got down
[Verse 5: Kurupt]
Switches, bitches, chrome deep dishes
Impalas, pop collars and pop collar bones
It's California, Gangstaville, in ya mouth, all up on ya
Cologne, you California
I'm Chuck All Stars, chronic sack, skull hat, Nissan truck
Not to give a fuck, Kurupt
86 gang bang, World War III
Thunder Dome, Crenshaw, Chemical Ali
California nigga!

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy, Truth Hurts] + (Sly Boogy)

[Verse 6: Crooked I]
The women hop in the whip
They love the way the speakers be subbin' in eight places
I represent Cali like Governor Gray Davis
On roller coaster rims, I own my own company pal
I'm slangin' spinners, how you lovin' me now
In L.A. you gotta be do or die in junior high
He's Sly, I'm Crooked I and we ride - you know?!
And I'm Death Row, heartless and lethal
You seen Menace to Society, I should start in the sequel
Yeeah

[Verse 7: Roscoe]
Blaze up the sticky dro, raise up the '64
Sittin' low at the liquor store
He's better than generous, inconsiderate
On a shwe wit a cigarette
You know that nigga Young Roscoe rollin' in the Cadillac
Rag on these (on these)
I got my Khakillac (Khakis) saggin' wit the crease
And everybody wanna know like, ""what's up wit Sco?""
It's Y.A. Killafornia!
[Verse 8: 2Pac]
Know for doin' scandalous deeds, no handlin' me
And nah it ain't the drugs, it's the straight thug nigga in me
I swoop down and cause havoc
My rapid delivery is automatic, lettin' niggas have it
I been labelled as a thug nigga
Since they don't sell my shit to white folks, ship it to the drug dealers
And catch a, catch a nigga worldwide
A fucking Mob Figga, West Coast who ride!

And I feel like going The Blacker The Berry on the ass of a hobgoblin
To get back at all of faggots from HomeTown

This is like being stabbed in the chest

So get to the lifeboats and cast off while you can

We are the masters of our passion as it falls off a cliff

And within these walls night after night
Know you spotted I been here too long
You cast a spell on me, now the magic's much too strong
Woah woah woah, for me
When I first met you, when we kissed
You had those eyes a man just can't resist
And like a spider, you spun your web
What started out as love turned into a raging fire instead

Out of control now there's no escape from loving you
Been in prison from the moment you came
I've tried to break free, I can't get loose
Something always pulls me back here again
Can't break these chains

I'm a captive, I'm a slave to love
When I'm around you I just can't get enough
In the beginning it was fantasy
Now I'm a victim of desire, addicted to my ecstacy
Can't get away, no there's no escape to loving you
Been in prison from the moment you came
I've tried to break free, I can't get loose
Something always pulls me back here again
Can't break these chains

[Hook: Apollo Lofton]
Look, there’s validation in my words, will I get what I deserve?
I observe who’s really down for me
In this life you gotta learn, even when you’re getting burned
This is earned, you don’t have to lie to me

[Verse 1: Apollo Lofton]
You don’t get it, the type of pain that I been through will change you
Reinvented, I’m not the same when I’m sentimental
Had to get it, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Look at Hov like a God on these instrumentals
Now I got it, understanding of pockets
Understanding of promo and how to do it for Lofton
And how to pitch you my talent, at events that you planning
But honestly f*ck your party, I rather be locked in
My biggest problem is I’m introverted
I got no balance when I’m really hurting
I’m well deserving of the crown, and everything that’s meant for me
I been through life long enough, you can’t get close to me
I keep space, having a hard time trying to figure it out
Right time to bring you around my place cause I
Don’t trust you, and I won’t hug you, and I
Will dub you, get the f*ck up out my face
[Hook: Apollo Lofton]
There’s validation in my words, will I get what I deserve?
I observe who’s really down for me
In this life you gotta learn, even when you’re getting burned
This is earned, you don’t have to lie to me
Got some problems with my trust, not your ordinary love
This is lust baby, you won’t die for me
I’m introverted til’ the day that I’m gone
Nobody got me so I got my own, who gon ride for me?

[Verse 2: Apollo Lofton]
Huh, and you know the truth
I’m terrified of getting closure so I rather move, hold up
Look, and I’m not amused
If we talking bout loyalty, I know a few
But I rather keep it to myself, nobody know me like me
Type of pain I carry round, it’s a burden for me
Nobody searching for me, low key murdering me
Until I cut the game up, you see the surgeon in me, Lofton
It was never pressure
It was always business first, it was never pleasure
I know the ropes cause I had to wrestle
Used to be at every function now I’m knowing better
I’m never out now, I’m barely friendly at all
F*ck your small talk, show me who you really are, right?
I’m introverted til’ the day that I’m gone
You either love me or you leave me alone

And if thou knock at Angells dores they show
An Empty Barrell: they no soul bread have.
Alas! Poore Bird, the Worlds White Loafe is done

Out streams of Grace: And he to end all strife

Disht on thy Table up by Angells Hands.

Which from his Table came, and to thine goeth?
Doth he bespeake thee thus, This Soule Bread take.

Its Food too fine for Angells, yet come, take
And Eate thy fill. Its Heavens Sugar Cake.

Closed minds and an open wound
Don't speak unless spoken to
Closed mouths wanting golden spoons
Black and his English it broke in two
Olde English toking dreams of blue

But quoted books from scholars
And now I'm graduating college (true)
They'll never take away my soul
They Already took control
Took away the gold
You ain't even know
You just living life ignorance is bliss
Stories never told voices never heard
You just keep it down (word)
You don't lean on me, we just lean on lean
Meaning sipping that (syrup)
You tryna live behind the eyelids
System got you blinded

I'm aiming way beyond it

As right as right as right can be right

Is that if I lived 'till I was a hundred and two

Looking back to the past
Its here with you
Not letting fear control the pain, the wild emotion
All the change you write the chapter, its your move

Oh was it far way
When memories of lakeway drives in boundary plain
Do eat in fields and throw frisbee one more time in the comfort of your air
Oh from Baker to the bay

I realized what my heart realized long before
The harder you kick, the longer you stick, the worse it will get
Only to wait for, only to wait for

Setting Things Right Again,pop,Behind Enemy Lines,2001,127,{},"I am George W. Bush and you best not cross my path
Because now I have the backing and you're going to feel my wrath
The Christian right adore me because I swore to carry out god's will
Can you believe that they're my strongest support considering how I love to kill?
They can live with murder on death row but not Roe vs. Wade
So I promised them if they got me elected some changes would be made
So now those irresponsible teenagers will be forced to have a kid
It makes no difference to me I don't sleep around like Clinton did
Are we now to regress back to the Reagan years, the ruling elite's wet dream?
Where capital punishment is viewed as civilized but art and music as obscene
Claiming that they're for less government rule in livelihood as they set the stage
To tip the scales in the companies favor, freeze the minimum wage
Fight to reinstate prayer in public schools and make the christians proud
Appoint Supreme Court justices who will insure that abortion is disallowed
Cutting all of the medical coverage for those inflicted with A.I.D.S
And push the gays back in the closet in hopes that their movement fades
I can't relate to homosexuals so I'll keep same sex marriages banned
In fact the only dick I like is my second in command
You may remember Mr. Cheeney he was one of my daddy's peers
And he'll really be an asset if he can live for four more years
He's a veteran of the trenches so I put him on my team
Because it's time to bring back all the tactics of the Reagan-Bush regime
With Jeb's help I stole the election and brought the liberal era to an end
And although the left-wing will not like it I'm going to set things right again
They initiate absurdity that to them makes perfect sense
Cut out every social program and simultaneously build up our defense
That they'll mostly use for internal conflict, like when the activists â€˜attack'
And the provoked protectors of the law have no choice but to fight back
When assessing what the problem is their lack of judgment never fails
And the only answer that they have is to build more jails
Every time the standard of living drops and a rise in crime ensues
They never attribute it to survival but a lack of family values
I'm here to restore dignity to the Whitehouse once again
And I can't do that in reality so I'll guess I'll just pretend
It's no big shock that I'll starve the poor and cater to those with wealth
In fact the only thing that may surprise you is that I manage to dress myself
I am definitely not the brightest man my brain is pretty lame
The only reason I made it this far is that I have my daddy's name
But as long as I'm your president you better learn to pray

Stars and Stripes of Corruption,rock,Dead Kennedys,1985,7445,{},"Finally got to Washington in the middle of the night
I couldn't wait, I headed straight for the Capitol Mall
My heart began to pound, yahoo, it really exists
The American International Pictures logo

I looked up at that Capitol building, couldn't help but wonder why
I felt like saying ""Hello, old friend""
Walked up the hill to touch it, then I unzipped my pants
And pissed on it when nobody was looking

Like a great eternal Klansman with his two flashing red eyes
Turn around, he's always watching
The Washington Monument pricks the sky
Flags for pubic hair ringed 'round the bottom

The symbols of our heritage lit up proudly in the night
Somehow fits to see the homeless people passed out on the lawn
So this is where it happens, the power games and the bribes
All lobbying for a piece of ass of the stars and stripes of corruption

Makes me feel so ashamed to be an American
When we're too stuck up to learn from our mistakes
Trying to start another Vietnam like fiddling while Rome burns at home
The boss says you're laid off, blame the Japanese
America's back, alright, at the game it plays the worst
Strip mining the world like a slave plantation
No wonder others hate us and the Hitlers we handpick
To bleed their people dry for our evil empire

The drug we're fed to make us like it is God and country with a bang
People we know who should know better
Howl ""America rules, let's go to war!""
Business scams are what's worth dying for

But are the Soviets our worst enemy? We're destroying ourselves instead
Who cares about our civil rights as long as I get paid
The blind me-generation doesn't care if life's a lie
So easily used, so proud to enforce the stars and stripes of corruption

Let's bring it all down
Let's bring It all down
Let's bring it all down
Down, down, down, down, down

Tell me who's the real patriots, the Archie Bunker slobs waving flags
Or the people with the guts to work for some real change?
Rednecks and bombs don't make us strong, we loot the world, yet we can't even feed ourselves
Our real test of strength is caring, not the war toys we sell the world

Just carry on, thankful to be farmed like worms
Old glory for a blanket as you suck on your thumbs
Real freedom scares you 'cause it means responsibility
So you chicken out and threaten me
Saying, ""Love it or leave it,"" I'll get beat up if I criticize it
You say you'll fight to the death to save your useless flag
If you want a banana republic that bad
Why don't you go move to one?

But what can just one of us do
Against all that money and power trying to crush us into roaches?
We won't destroy society in a day
Until we change ourselves first from the inside out

We can start by not lying so much
And treating other people like dirt
It's so easy not to base our lives on how much we can scam
And you know it feels good to lift that monkey off our back

I'm thankful I live in a place where I can say the things I do
Without being taken out and shot
So I'm on guard against the goons trying to take my rights away
We've got to rise above the need for cops and laws

Let kids learn communication instead of schools pushing competition
How about more art and theater instead of sports?
People will always do drugs, let's legalize them, crime drops when the mob can't price them
Budget's in the red, let's tax religion

No one will do it for us, we'll just have to fix ourselves
Honesty ain't all that hard
Just put Rambo back inside your pants
Causing trouble for the system is much more fun
Thank you for the toilet paper, but your flag is meaningless to me
Look around, we're all people, who needs countries anyway?
Our land, I love it too, I think I love it more than you
I care enough to fight the stars and stripes of corruption

Let's bring it all down
Let's bring it all down, let's bring it all down

I wish I’d had the foresight to give my fingers more time
Instead I let them get bored, on the fretboard
But now I’ve found a course, and got it cracked like a fault line
I learnt less in all my life than in the last fortnight
Propelled my elevation level as if it was cordite
Now I can hack at my axe, and rock it all night
If rock is a thrill ride, then Rocksmith’s your tour guide
Of course I’ve still got to put the time into it
But the fact is with practice, I know I can do it

[Hook]
Now I’m a Rocksmith
I learned a lot quick
Never mind pressing buttons
I know how to pluck strings
Now I’m a Rocksmith
I learned a lot quick
I never dreamed
I’d be able to play such things
[Verse 2]
Unlike the Deftones, I was tone def
Leppards never change their spots, I’m just a radiohead
Music left me with an aching head, not a head rush
Crimson red blush, less trust then Jeb Bush
I’m not an early riser, could never rise against
The procrastination, it was always I versus them
I couldn’t find a muse, or iron out the kinks
I could kiss goodbye to screaming females, I was jinxed
Wanted to slay em ike I’m waving a katana
Or magic wands, make a splashh, take them to Nirvana
Play in my pyjamas, as heavy as a monster truck
Never mind the who, what, why, no-one wants to suck
The police in Boston aren’t even as tough as this
RSI, callouses and blisters, I’ve suffered it
But I’ll never stop playing guitar
Until all that remains of my nails are scars

[Hook x2]
Now I’m a Rocksmith
I learned a lot quick
Never mind pressing buttons
I know how to pluck strings
Now I’m a Rocksmith

Containing a Very Tragical Incident,misc,Henry Fielding,1749,10,{},"While Jones was employed in those unpleasant meditations, with which we left him tormenting himself, Partridge came stumbling into the room with his face paler than ashes, his eyes fixed in his head, his hair standing an end, and every limb trembling. In short, he looked as he would have done had he seen a spectre, or had he, indeed, been a spectre himself.

Jones, who was little subject to fear, could not avoid being somewhat shocked at this sudden appearance. He did, indeed, himself change colour, and his voice a little faultered while he asked him, What was the matter?

""I hope, sir,"" said Partridge, ""you will not be angry with me. Indeed I did not listen, but I was obliged to stay in the outward room. I am sure I wish I had been a hundred miles off, rather than have heard what I have heard."" ""Why, what is the matter?"" said Jones. ""The matter, sir? O good Heaven!"" answered Partridge, ""was that woman who is just gone out the woman who was with you at Upton?"" ""She was, Partridge,"" cried Jones. ""And did you really, sir, go to bed with that woman?"" said he, trembling.—""I am afraid what past between us is no secret,"" said Jones.—""Nay, but pray, sir, for Heaven's sake, sir, answer me,"" cries Partridge. ""You know I did,"" cries Jones. ""Why then, the Lord have mercy upon your soul, and forgive you,"" cries Partridge; ""but as sure as I stand here alive, you have been a-bed with your own mother.""

Upon these words Jones became in a moment a greater picture of horror than Partridge himself. He was, indeed, for some time struck dumb with amazement, and both stood staring wildly at each other. At last his words found way, and in an interrupted voice he said, ""How! how! what's this you tell me?"" ""Nay, sir,"" cries Partridge, ""I have not breath enough left to tell you now, but what I have said is most certainly true.—That woman who now went out is your own mother. How unlucky was it for you, sir, that I did not happen to see her at that time, to have prevented it! Sure the devil himself must have contrived to bring about this wickedness.""

""Sure,"" cries Jones, ""Fortune will never have done with me till she hath driven me to distraction. But why do I blame Fortune? I am myself the cause of all my misery. All the dreadful mischiefs which have befallen me are the consequences only of my own folly and vice. What thou hast told me, Partridge, hath almost deprived me of my senses! And was Mrs Waters, then—but why do I ask? for thou must certainly know her—If thou hast any affection for me, nay, if thou hast any pity, let me beseech thee to fetch this miserable woman back again to me. O good Heavens! incest——with a mother! To what am I reserved!"" He then fell into the most violent and frantic agonies of grief and despair, in which Partridge declared he would not leave him; but at last, having vented the first torrent of passion, he came a little to himself; and then, having acquainted Partridge that he would find this wretched woman in the same house where the wounded gentleman was lodged, he despatched him in quest of her.

If the reader will please to refresh his memory, by turning to the scene at Upton, in the ninth book, he will be apt to admire the many strange accidents which unfortunately prevented any interview between Partridge and Mrs Waters, when she spent a whole day there with Mr Jones. Instances of this kind we may frequently observe in life, where the greatest events are produced by a nice train of little circumstances; and more than one example of this may be discovered by the accurate eye, in this our history.

After a fruitless search of two or three hours, Partridge returned back to his master, without having seen Mrs Waters. Jones, who was in a state of desperation at his delay, was almost raving mad when he brought him his account. He was not long, however, in this condition before he received the following letter:

""SIR,

""Since I left you I have seen a gentleman, from whom I have learned something concerning you which greatly surprizes and affects me; but as I have not at present leisure to communicate a matter of such high importance, you must suspend your curiosity till our next meeting, which shall be the first moment I am able to see you. O, Mr Jones, little did I think, when I past that happy day at Upton, the reflection upon which is like to embitter all my future life, who it was to whom I owed such perfect happiness. Believe me to be ever sincerely your unfortunate

""J. WATERS.""

""P.S. I would have you comfort yourself as much as possible, for Mr Fitzpatrick is in no manner of danger; so that whatever other grievous crimes you may have to repent of, the guilt of blood is not among the number.""
Jones having read the letter, let it drop (for he was unable to hold it, and indeed had scarce the use of any one of his faculties). Partridge took it up, and having received consent by silence, read it likewise; nor had it upon him a less sensible effect. The pencil, and not the pen, should describe the horrors which appeared in both their countenances. While they both remained speechless the turnkey entered the room, and, without taking any notice of what sufficiently discovered itself in the faces of them both, acquainted Jones that a man without desired to speak with him. This person was presently introduced, and was no other than Black George.

As sights of horror were not so usual to George as they were to the turnkey, he instantly saw the great disorder which appeared in the face of Jones. This he imputed to the accident that had happened, which was reported in the very worst light in Mr Western's family; he concluded, therefore, that the gentleman was dead, and that Mr Jones was in a fair way of coming to a shameful end. A thought which gave him much uneasiness; for George was of a compassionate disposition, and notwithstanding a small breach of friendship which he had been over-tempted to commit, was, in the main, not insensible of the obligations he had formerly received from Mr Jones.

The poor fellow, therefore, scarce refrained from a tear at the present sight. He told Jones he was heartily sorry for his misfortunes, and begged him to consider if he could be of any manner of service. ""Perhaps, sir,"" said he, ""you may want a little matter of money upon this occasion; if you do, sir, what little I have is heartily at your service.""

Jones shook him very heartily by the hand, and gave him many thanks for the kind offer he had made; but answered, ""He had not the least want of that kind."" Upon which George began to press his services more eagerly than before. Jones again thanked him, with assurances that he wanted nothing which was in the power of any man living to give. ""Come, come, my good master,"" answered George, ""do not take the matter so much to heart. Things may end better than you imagine; to be sure you an't the first gentleman who hath killed a man, and yet come off."" ""You are wide of the matter, George,"" said Partridge, ""the gentleman is not dead, nor like to die. Don't disturb my master, at present, for he is troubled about a matter in which it is not in your power to do him any good."" ""You don't know what I may be able to do, Mr Partridge,"" answered George; ""if his concern is about my young lady, I have some news to tell my master."" ""What do you say, Mr George?"" cried Jones. ""Hath anything lately happened in which my Sophia is concerned? My Sophia! how dares such a wretch as I mention her so profanely."" ""I hope she will be yours yet,"" answered George. ""Why yes, sir, I have something to tell you about her. Madam Western hath just brought Madam Sophia home, and there hath been a terrible to do. I could not possibly learn the very right of it; but my master he hath been in a vast big passion, and so was Madam Western, and I heard her say, as she went out of doors into her chair, that she would never set her foot in master's house again. I don't know what's the matter, not I, but everything was very quiet when I came out; but Robin, who waited at supper, said he had never seen the squire for a long while in such good humour with young madam; that he kissed her several times, and swore she should be her own mistress, and he never would think of confining her any more. I thought this news would please you, and so I slipped out, though it was so late, to inform you of it."" Mr Jones assured George that it did greatly please him; for though he should never more presume to lift his eyes toward that incomparable creature, nothing could so much relieve his misery as the satisfaction he should always have in hearing of her welfare.

The rest of the conversation which passed at the visit is not important enough to be here related. The reader will, therefore, forgive us this abrupt breaking off, and be pleased to hear how this great good-will of the squire towards his daughter was brought about.

Mrs Western, on her first arrival at her brother's lodging, began to set forth the great honours and advantages which would accrue to the family by the match with Lord Fellamar, which her niece had absolutely refused; in which refusal, when the squire took the part of his daughter, she fell immediately into the most violent passion, and so irritated and provoked the squire, that neither his patience nor his prudence could bear it any longer; upon which there ensued between them both so warm a bout at altercation, that perhaps the regions of Billingsgate never equalled it. In the heat of this scolding Mrs Western departed, and had consequently no leisure to acquaint her brother with the letter which Sophia received, which might have possibly produced ill effects; but, to say truth, I believe it never once occurred to her memory at this time.

When Mrs Western was gone, Sophia, who had been hitherto silent, as well indeed from necessity as inclination, began to return the compliment which her father had made her, in taking her part against her aunt, by taking his likewise against the lady. This was the first time of her so doing, and it was in the highest degree acceptable to the squire. Again, he remembered that Mr Allworthy had insisted on an entire relinquishment of all violent means; and, indeed, as he made no doubt but that Jones would be hanged, he did not in the least question succeeding with his daughter by fair means; he now, therefore, once more gave a loose to his natural fondness for her, which had such an effect on the dutiful, grateful, tender, and affectionate heart of Sophia, that had her honour, given to Jones, and something else, perhaps, in which he was concerned, been removed, I much doubt whether she would not have sacrificed herself to a man she did not like, to have obliged her father. She promised him she would make it the whole business of her life to oblige him, and would never marry any man against his consent; which brought the old man so near to his highest happiness, that he was resolved to take the other step, and went to bed completely drunk.",155787,en,en,en

Loose your mind

Her green eyes makes go crazy
This girl turns me on

Babe let me be the driver
Let me fix what they did
Your dimensional ego
Will never push me away
I’m ready for the challenge
I am ready to find that edge
That soft vulnerable edge
That you try to camouflage

So sweet makes me wana kiss her lips
The type of girl to bring back to my family
But she's not the type to give herself easily
Insecure
Protective
Impenetrable
Her structure irrational
She gat them perfect curves
That makes you go on cloud 9
Miss independent is her last name
Everyday i wish she could be mine
Makes her smile
Giver her everything she wants
This girl is so dangerous
Booty so big got nothing to lose

You said i was never good for you
Yeah i messed up once or twice
But i was always there for you

Get out of here
And tell me u miss me
I can't take ur lies no more

But don't mess with it
They say what goes around
Comes back around
But like scar
Never you will fade away

Don’t let me walk out of your life
This could be your biggest mistake
But if you decide to let go
Remember you left your footprints

Yah
Uh

[Verse 1]
Started in Lake Illawarra
With a mate’s CD Player that I borrowed, I came with the mob
Pavin' a way for tomorrow
Today I’ma take on a calling, I’m makin’ a mark
Play it with the flame in the chords
In a way they don’t make anymore, wagin’ a war
With the words I'ma say when I talk
And I’m aimin’ to break in the doors, so be careful
I’m kickin' that down, with the way
That I’m bringin’ that sound, Murawari Filipino
Reppin’ that proud, straight flame
When I’m in the bag now, rent time’s up
Gon' give it back now, I can feel a change comin'
In the background, workin’ to eliminate
The middle man now, lookin' like a man
Caught with your pants down, thanks for the TED Talk
Blakfella got game
Take it up a notch, high-level octane
Shit is off chain from the minute I came
Fuck up anybody that’d get in my lane, runaway
Throw dirt on my name
Better get a brolly, I’m bringin’ that rain
Big up to the Mob takin’ all of that pain
Never givin’ up, yo, we come a long way
So I raise my fist, got the flag on my wrist
Callin' out all my Brits, you can uplift
Look at what all of y’all missed
Educate all of your kids, break that chain
Look at how I write my shit
Ain’t nobody quite like this, fight my fight
Same time, make it bop like this?
I am what hip-hop is
Many nights tryna follow my calling
I had a fantasy of globally touring
While my friends goin’ out to the party
I’m home alone; Macaulay McCaulakin
I would treat every show like a tournament
Pull up on ‘em with the flow and I’m gone again
Mob are killin' it so shout out to all of ‘em
Kobie Dee, Baker Boy, Emma Donovan, ayy
Man, all these comments are filthy
Look at them, brittle and guilty
I know I stand for something way bigger than lil me
I don’t back down if it kills me
If they like you milky
I gotta remind you, my brother, it’s still tea
Even if they try to spill me, I'ma soak into this land
And this always will be, ayy
[Verse 2]
Yo
Big up to Byrd, that's the sample that I'm flippin'
Attitude matchin' up with the writtens
Backward politicians are catchin’ up with the vision
Rappers always thinkin' they different but never listen
I’m sick of this repetition, I’m wishin’ for recognition
Seekin’ action for the mass killin’ in Blak prison
The bad image that lackin' media fact checkin’
The blood spillin', land drillin’, frack dealin’
I’ll shatter the ceilin’ like Bob Dylan and Madvillain
Sick of the politickin' and keepin' the cash hidden
Ditchin’ the blacks, coward too chicken to chat with ‘em
Historic oppression, our mother tongue was forbidden
Morrison never listened, strip him of his position
Unforgiven, so I manifest it in my mind
Hope I see a Blak Prime Minister in my lifetime
I devise rhymes on bike rides at night-time
And keep my mind’s eye open to a divine sign
Ayy, and still the problem they been tryna get rid of
Whitewash the hip-hop, like they forgot the founders
Munkimuk to Jimblah, South West Syndicate
Local Knowledge, don’t forget, brah, watch it splinter up
’06, we had the whitest men lead
But they forgot about Wire MC
We pull out we’d leave your line-up empty, dead scene
Your entire event seems like the Fyre Fest thing, this a writer’s wet dream
Ayy, caught the passion back in Warilla
With the wide brim hat, packin' the Bega Stringers
With the pads, rappin’ to Dilla tracks on the back of the bus
‘Bout to become the butterfly up out the caterpillar
Blakfella Mac Miller, Anderson .Paak
With a killer act, lyric attack struck with a battle axe
Matter fact, I’m thinkin’ I shouldn’t have to brag
But after this shit they might have to call it Drappertag

Was your thighs hugging my face
My mouth in places unseen
And we'll be one hour lovers
Adore the way that I fuck ya

99 was a pretty nice time

A skin dripping melanin, pretty black child
Who never needed some medicine, he was just fine
99'

(Verse 1)
All my enemies will forever fall
Im in that phase where my energy is impeccable
They thought my pain would just damage me and affect the boy
-I've fallen down but i've risen up and I left and gone
Now im away, like a star in the space
You need a telescope to see the scars on my face
Hell is only a page your mind should try to erase
And heaven is just a place your mind is posed to vacate
I've learnt that, when I had cigarettes in my backpack
High school, mad stress, trapped inside a math class
Thinking of the studio and the song imma rap next
-Back when I was sure that im a mad man
Now I scream gang-gang, shooting stars like bratt-tatt
I swear man, all the pain in this damn world, I felt that
Fell back, demons tried to catch me, pacman
-But i survived because Jesus is a blackman

(Verse 2)
You should be thankful because you breathing
And you should pray a lot, that'll chase away all the demons
That contribute to your weakness, and blocking you from achievement
He'll fill you with blessings even though your cup ain't the cleanest
I've been around the city and im still walking the distance
Im wise enough to show you the higher power's existence
Nigga I am the witness, im symbolizing persistence
God is not giving me pain, he is crystalizing my senses
-Look around, depression's on the rise
Its written down in statistics its not a myth or a lie
The kids are trapped in a system, its reallt hard to survive
All we need is a parademic, we really bleeding inside
But neither you and I -should never ever utilise
All our mental energies writing letters of suicide
Believe! Heal your energy and your mind
The place that you can find your awakening is the dark

Started from weed, big smoke outs
Before you could exhale, blunt in your mouth
Sham, Nay, blew you blew
Now you need something else to do
A new high to try, a new place to go
Introduced to the yay to the yo
House full of girls, old and young
Plate on the table takin one on ones
Use dollar bills just to snort the lines
You see the big girls do it so of
Course it's fine
Cocaine enforced on your mind
Now blow, then they blow in ya time

Supplying people with they fix
Where you fit?
On Fillmore Street is where you sit
Don't go in the house till you move a zip
Worked a day and night shift
To stay awake, a nigga might sniff
Not too much cuz you might slip
Instead of 28, you cookin 26
Keep a gat and a pack in the sock
Take a couple of toots, then its back to the block
Back to the service out the sack
Experimenting with that soft, wonder 'bout that crack, huh?
One try, another try without a doubt
Papered out, always at the powder house
Day time, night time, nigga powdered out
Could've been a papered-up powerhouse

You like to blow? Like Boston George?
You want some more, for you and your whores?

And corporate doors, executive nose sore
Rich man high, eight balls and quarters
They call me, placing they orders
Bring me across the border, buyin the cake
Before I'm sold, they take the taste
Snortin habit, not worth affordin
Some use me, strictly out of boredom

My legs they have no places to go
My head gets way too tired to hold
All these people, places, and memories and monsters I know

CHORUS (Donn O’ Day)
Life moves faster when you try to catch up
And my soul doesn’t move like it used to
Am I changing
Rearranging
Do I stay the same
Cause I don’t want to grow old

VERSE 2
And I really miss the days
When things were same and sane
And Daddy kept the fire blazing
The sirens on the Saturdays
When Momma fried filets
And kept that food from wasting
We laid in the back of yards
To back of bars
To back of cars
To packed in basements
Shots rang on my boulevard
And all has changed
And childhoods lost to homes invaded
Take me home
While I’m actin a fool
Program me right after the school
Church me in the back of the pews
Learn me
Work me
Burn me
Hurt me like they hurting you too
And now that we’re perfectly damaged
We’re all fit to manage a child of our own
In our own broken homes
Housing our cells
And our hells
And our veils
And our wells
And our selves
But these trees don’t get climbed no more
And these clothes don’t get ironed no more
And these holes never hide no more
Cause these things get us by no more

When these dreams wonder why no more
And these swings get us high no more
The feelings you feel when you feel like them feelings ain’t ever been felt before

CHORUS

VERSE 3 (Grier Smith)
I don’t wanna grow old, no more
Closer to a casket, I was much
Closer to being happy
When they was pulling rabbits outta hats
These days I lost my magic
These days it’s hard for me to laugh when
These bills debt calls Uncle Sam collecting taxes
Gotta hit the IRS like I don’t have it
Biggie said we living better now
Most of my nights come with cold sweats I sweat it out Birthdays be the worst days
Another candle on the cake
Feels like I lost a handle on my faith
Feels like I’m moving closer to my fate
But they say everybody gotta go someday
Since a kid I ain’t been living right
There’s monsters on that other side
Eternity’s a long time
Looking for a compromise
I said I wanna grow up
Right now I’m ducking Father Time
I’m living off a borrowed time
VERSE 4 (AteloMidas)
I just want to feel embraced
Seen people and dreams all get thrown away
Let me just make a Way
To a place that I'll never have to race
Never have to pace, or look myself up in the face
What happens when my heroes pass away?
That's daily, can I count maybe
Why do you forsake me?
When I need you the most
I remember watching you like it was seasons ago
How many seasons to go?
Cause I no longer can take it
Addict of the future now lost in the basement
It's baseless, but the time ain't the proof don't chase it
But the time ain't the proof don't chase it
Cause we don't know how the story goes
And we always try to change our roles
Only God knows how this all unfolds
I suppose the monster is that we always try to know
The Unknown

Out Of Reach,pop,Royal Hunt,2001,128,{},"Chapter August 2002 - Night Meeting

On the road of disillusions
In the land of broken dreams
From the city of confusions
Scared to death I'm running - or so it seems

In the sun my heart is freezing
Mind is boiling in the shade
And a mean mirage is teasing
'cross the endless desert, that's due to fade out

By now, but still around
Makes me wonder why we're here
On this unholy ground

I feel you're near, I hear your call, I see your shadow on the wall
I know you're here day after day, but every time - one step away
Divided only in our mind, why can't we see another's side?
Out of my fear I'll build the bridge - you are so close but out of reach
I can't tell you where I'm going
I can't tell you where I've been
I just run without knowing
What I did, you know what, just what I mean?

I gave up on understanding
I let go the foolish pride
Won't expect a happy ending -
Not this time, I know it - but it's alright

'coz me and you're the same -
Even 1000 years apart
I got someone to blame

We were looking at each other
While the ones we'll never see
Only feel, have slowly passed you...
And me

I feel you're near, I hear your call, I see your shadow on the wall
I know you're here day after day, but every time - one step away
Divided only in our mind, why can't we see another's side?

Covers the trees

As the World turns , I am your light.
The universe has no end, on and on, and miles away
Just like my love knows nothing else but to shout your name
As the World turns, the stars fade away.
With your hand guiding the way
And your heart soothing the pain
As the World turns, we walk as one.
The sun rises up in the morning shy
I open my eyes to watch you fly
A silent tear rolls down my cheek
Waiting for you to come back to me.
I’ll find my way back home
Alone in the dark and through the cold,
I wish you luck, I wish you love
In this trip you call “Life”.
I’ll wait for you,
I’ll be your home,
I’ll be your friend,
I’ll be your love.

As the World turns, you come as well

Finding myself unfound
And so I turned right to myself
Sayin' ""Hey, why don't you find your way out?""

The one thing you mustn't
Know is to know you knew it all
So go on lookin' for it
But just know you've had it all along

[Chorus]
I thought I knew I thought I was in the know
But you can't know, I think, until you forget it
All that you do is also all that you don't
You won't hold a thing unless you just let it go

Say, did you see you're everywhere -
You're just not here at all?
We'd play hide and seek, but it might be a cheat
If you're no different from the wall!
To play the game is that to seek is to be found
Sometimes lookin' in is just the same as lookin' out

There is a place I like to go, I go there all the time
Maybe I could take you there if you'd pay me no mind

Oh, what a dream, this thing I'm seein'!
Spin the wheel, make it go round and round and round
I go around and round and round
And just like everything, when I go up I'm comin' down
And gettin' in is gettin' out
Let's go again, I go around, round and round and…

[Chorus]

I think I knew, I think I've known it this whole time

Recurring in my mind when I met you

All arranged by you
Yeah was nothing true?

And now you look past my eyes
As if you're waiting for a vice
To have a cause to leave again

You're going to take it without a feeling
Making your relation tactical
Do you really want to offend me in this way
Don't say: what do I care

I behold
You're so cold
Live and win
By your maxim
You say all your freedom's gone
You're sure of where you belong
Now you must budge from my side

I don't understand
Don't you need a hand
A hand of tenderness
What do you repress?

So we're here at daggers drawn
After calm now comes the storm
I never wanted this variance

You're going to take it without a feeling
Making your relation tactical
Do you really want to offend me in this way
Don't say: what do I care

Won't mean a thing dear, if you're not here with me

And the wind knows blue snowflakes start falling
When those blue, blue memories start calling
You'll be doing alright
With your Christmas of white
Oh, but I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

You'll be doing alright
With your Christmas of white
Oh, but I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

And when you need and pray on this Christmas day
Remember I have a blue, blue Christmas

Sure enough she coming back around
Tryna hit me back up with a line

New fans, new problems
New women, new drama

Dare ya to go against me, know that you gotta be mad (uhh)

New whip for the road

Prolly why I stay alone
Come and tell me what you bout
Clout chasing, oh you really on?

Best to stay up on your game before you say you smashed Mellay, God of fire, ride and rollin, lava flowing past pele

Time goes by (45 minutes later)
Time goes by (and now one hour later...)

A car pulls up to a restaurant; the door opens as someone gets out
First thing you see is some heels and a dress black shades on scarf around her head and mouth
Who could it be, why are they here up the stairs there going
Through the door down the aisle like she's walking in slow motion
Checking out the place as she walks looking real cool
Peeping out through her glasses before she sits in the booth
She goes in her purse throws a cigarette out, put it in her mouth he lights it
Then she blows smoke, pause for a minutes and says ""what the hell happened? ""
""First of all woman keep your voice down I ain't try'na get loud up in here
Second of all how was I to know that'cha husband, was a fucking queer""
""Shh"" (clears throat) The waitress walks by
She says ""I'll be with y'all in a minute""
""Now we made a deal the plan was for me to come home with you, girl I did my part
So don't you go asking me what the hell happened when I didn't want to do this shit from the start""
And then she says ""yeah right, you didn't want to do this shit but'cha ass got paid
And then she says ""Sylvester"" I said ""hold up bitch are you crazy, don't be saying my name""
She said ""whatever, how come you did tell me you was married to Gwen? ""
""First of all between the fake wigs and fake names how the hell am I suppose to know that Gwen is yo friend, bitch I'm a-""
""Shh, here comes the waitress again""
""Sorry I kept y'all waiting, childish place is busy
It's always crowded about this time can I start y'all off with sumthing to drink? ""
I said ""I'll just have a coffee with two sugars light on the cream""
And she said ""Vodka straight up, hell, shit I need a drink""
Then the waitress said ""girl I heard that I'll be right back with your drinks""
And then she walks away, I look back at her and says ""she look familiar too me""
And she says ""what? "" I say ""nothing, it's just a thought
Anyway girl I thought the plan was for me to be in that house with'chu and get caught""
She says ""It was"" I said ""what how? "" She say ""I changed my mind""
I blew smoke then I blew my cigar out said ""I'm out this motherfucker cause you wasting my time""
She says ""wait don't go"" ""well then god dammit, talk to me""
She says ""you wouldn't understand""
""Try me"" (Cathy sobs) ""Cathy"" ""Yes? "" ""Try me""
She blows her nose and says ""well it all started one night when I was sitting in the living room
And sounds like I can hear somebody in the bedroom moaning and groaning
And I knew it wasn't me, so my curiosity
Led me to believe that he was cheating on me""
""Well how come you just didn't ask him give him the benefit of the doubt? ""
""Because a woman knows, a woman just knows what some shit is foul""
And then I said ""calm down, here comes the waitress""
""Ooh like I said it's busy around this time, but thank y'all for being patient
Say can I get y'all anything else? "" I said ""no that'll be all""
Then Cathy says ""Sylvester"" he says ""hold on"", cause he's getting another phone call
It's Tawn saying ""everything aight? "" Then Sylvester says ""we working it out""
Then Tawn says ""well call me if you need me dawg you know I'm holding you down"" and I said ""no doubt""
I hang up then Cathy says ""well anyway let me get back to telling you what went wrong
Where was I, oh yeah the day I heard him arguing on the phone""
Now the story goes on and on and she telling him everything that happened
While Tawn's outside in the car, radio on bopping his head just rapping
Sylvester said, ""Girl are you saying he was having sex with another man on the phone? ""
She says ""yes"" I say ""I can't talk about this"" she says ""why? "" say ""cause this shit is getting uncomfortable""
Now back to Tawn he turns the radio down cause he gets a call
He says ""yeah whattup? "" and the voice says ""Yo T I got that information on Tina"" he says ""talk to me dawg""
""Well the word out on the street is the bitch is stop whoring, doing hair out her momma's basement and got a job, hahaha
""Haha is right the day that bitch stop horring is the day they stop selling dops"" (haha) ""Ya feel me Joe? "" (word)
""Where the bitch work at a candy sto'? ""
""Nah, the job that she got suppose to be legit, I heard ya girl off on some ole waitress shit""
""Yeah, waitress where? "" ""Hold on I'm waiting on my people to hit me, Roxanne and aunty on the place""
""You shittin' me, where this place at? "" He says ""Hold up, I'm getting a phone call""

Now meanwhile Sylvester's asking Cathy ""Well why you still love him? ""
Then Cathy says ""Cause when I saw Chuck I just couldn't lose him to him""
And then the waitress comes again but this time she brings the bill
I last her a fifty says keep the change she says ""damn thanks, shit y'all keep it real""
Now meanwhile outside in the car, Tawn's getting impatient his homie comes back to the phone
Tawn says ""do I look like En Vogue? "" He says ""why? "" he says ""nigga cause the way you got me holding on""
""I got'cha dawg, I got where the bitch work live information and all""
""Yeah nigga I'm listening"" ""well nigga first of all, you gotta keep me down cause I went through a lot of crazy shit to find her""
""Yeah whatever I got'chu""
""I'm dealing with some nigga in the jet free minders, round the corner is a place called Shay Shay's Diner
""Nigga you forget I just did 3 years, I need the exact address to where this place is""
""My bad you right kid, 9501 that's right off Halstead""
Pause it right there, now shoot back into the restaurant real quick

Sylvester looks up at the waitress and says ""excuse me but it seems like I know ya""
And at the same time Tawn's in the car going ""man this address sounds familiar""
Meanwhile in the restaurant the waitress blows her bubble and says ""where you know me from? ""
Tawn's homie gives him the name of the place again he looks up at the sign and says ""what the fuck? ""
Now meanwhile back in the restaurant Cathy's nudging me under the table going ""Sylvester""
Then Sylvester looks at the name tag on the shirt and notices that shit says ""TINA""
Then, the waitress starts backing up with this confused look on her face
While Tawn's outside on the phone telling his homie ""man I'm right outside of the fucking place""
Then Sylvester says ""hold up, I just wanna talk to you for a minute""
Then she starts screaming Roxanne's name real loud, this bitch comes running from the back with a skillet
Then Tina breaks her beer bottle on the table and says ""nigga I will cut you with this glass""
Cathy walks by me going out the door saying ""not try'na get loud in here my ass""
Tina starts wobbing around Sylvester real slow saying ""we take Tae-bo classes""
Then Tawn runs up in the place and says ""I will kill both of y'all knucklehead asses""",60588,en,en,en

The clouds were perfect
I liked the taste of freedom
And the light that blinded my eyes
But it was perfect

Very perfect

Little by little I was growing up
I learned what was good and what was evil
What a woman was
Very delicate and simple
And what a man was
Very strong and without feelings

But every time I grew up
Everything was more confusing
Because I could be delicate
And he could be strong, too
It could be very simple, but I could also cry

""You are perfect""

I am a human, as you can breathe
I am a human, and I am not made of metal

We humans feel
We hit very hard
And it hurts us because we have feelings

I am a human, and I am proud to say
That I can breathe

I am a human, as you can breathe
I'm a human, and I'm not made of metal

I can breath

The world lived on stereotypes
While the church was saying
That people who liked the same sex
They were sinful because they could not have children
And that was at odds with the laws of his god
But the church had priests, who could not have children
Were they also sinners?

Were they also sinners?

And I'm not against religion
Because God made me so, and faithful believer of him
I know the church spits us lies

I prefer to live my life
Being happy
Before I have a scalpel on my face

Because life does not try to be perfect
Or be as the society wants
Life tries to live
And that's why they gave us life

[Verse 1: Diverse Character]
Long nights fill the appetite
Stroll through the park in the afterlife
Hoping that Jesus walks in these latest flights
I’m just a young kid who never grew up flying kites
And flyer than the birds I never played with
I’m sicker than Magic Johnson when he isn't
I forgot to save me but feeling crazy just lately
Wasting all of my raps in these books of pages
They should pay me
Got bars like institutions
Got visions and resolutions
I feel the game has been polluted
I’m on the phone with Tim Allen
The home needs improvement
Birds fly me to the North
I’m searching for the love in the sport
Whole one join something led me to the court
Life’s a magazine I’m just searching through the source
What’s right how often questioned
It’s hard to function
Pen and pad is who I fell in love with
Make no assumptions
I’m from a place, they tell you run it
Or like a car you get jumped quick
They be on some dumb shit
Lord save my soul, niggas on my heels
They fake Gucci so it’s hard to tell what’s real
They feel as though they medicine
That's why they popping pills
Demons in [?] often give me chills
Ain't no discussion
Chicken’s run when they dumpin'
I freed the underground like I’m Tubman
That’s why rappers in the game they so often love me
They all slaves with famous names
A better chain doesn’t earn the bank
Yeah
I said, they all slaves and famous names
And better chain doesn’t earn the bank",2477410,en,en,en

""And the meek shall inherit the earth.""
II. Temples of Syrinx (2:13)

... ""The massive grey walls of the Temples rise from the heart of every Federation city. I have always been awed by them, to think that every single facet of every life is regulated and directed from within! Our books, our music, our work and play are all looked after by the benevolent wisdom of the priests...""

We've taken care of everything
The words you read
The songs you sing
The pictures that give pleasure
To your eye

One for all and all for one
Work together
Common sons
Never need to wonder
How or why

We are the Priests
Of the Temples of Syrinx
Our great computers
Fill the hallowed halls
We are the Priests
Of the Temples of Syrinx
All the gifts of life
Are held within our walls
Look around this world we made
Equality
Our stock in trade
Come and join the Brotherhood
Of Man
What a nice contented world
Let the banners
Be unfurled
Hold the Red Star proudly
High in hand
III. Discovery (3:29)

... ""Behind my beloved waterfall, in the little room that was hidden beneath the cave, I found it. I brushed away the dust of the years, and picked it up, holding it reverently in my hands. I had no idea what it might be, but it was beautiful"" ...
... ""I learned to lay my fingers across the wires, and to turn the keys to make them sound differently. As I struck the wires with my other hand, I produced my first harmonious sounds, and soon my own music! How different it could be from the music of the Temples! I can't wait to tell the priests about it! ...""

What can this strange device be?
When I touch it, it gives forth a sound
It's got wires that vibrate, and give music
What can this thing be that I found?

See how it sings like a sad heart
And joyously screams out its pain
Sounds that build high like a mountain
Or notes that fall gently, like rain

I can't wait to share this new wonder
The people will all see its light
Let them all make their own music
The Priests praise my name on this night
IV. Presentation (3:42)
... ""In the sudden silence as I finished playing, I looked up to a circle of grim, expressionless faces. Father Brown rose to his feet, and his somnolent voice echoed throughout the silent Temple Hall."" ...
... ""Instead of the grateful joy that I expected, they were words of quiet rejection! Instead of praise, sullen dismissal. I watched in shock and horror as Father Brown ground my precious instrument to splinters beneath his feet...""

I know it's most unusual
To come before you so
But I've found an ancient miracle
I thought that you should know

Listen to my music
And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you

The Priests:

Yes we know
It's nothing new
It's just a waste of time
We have no need for ancient ways
The world is doing fine
Another toy
That helped destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the plan
I can't believe you're saying
These things just can't be true
Our world could use this beauty
Just think what we might do

Listen to my music
And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you

The Priests:

Don't annoy us further
We have our work to do
Just think about the average
What use have they for you?
V. Oracle: The Dream (2:00)

... ""I guess it was a dream, but even now it all seems so vivid to me. Clearly yet I see the beckoning hand of the oracle as he stood at the summit of the staircase"" ...
... ""I see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and the pure spirit of man revealed in the lives and works of this world. I was overwhelmed by both wonder and understanding as I saw a completely different way to life, a way that had been crushed by the Federation long ago. I saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of all these things ...""

I wandered home though silent streets
And fell into a fitful sleep
Escape to realms beyond the night
Dream-can't you show me light

I stand atop a spiral stair
An oracle confronts me there
He leads me on, light years away
Through astral nights, galactic days

I see the works of gifted hands
Grace this strange and wondrous land
I see the hand of man arise
With hungry mind and open eyes

They left our planets long ago
The elder race still learn and grow
Their power grows with purpose strong
To claim the home, where they belong

Home, to tear the Temples down...
Home, to change-
VI. Soliloquy (2:21)

... ""I have not left this cave for days now, it has become my last refuge in my total despair. I have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me now. I can no longer live under the control of the Federation, but there is no other place to go. My last hope is that with my death I may pass into the world of my dream, and know peace at last.""

The sleep is still in my eyes
The dream is still in my head
I heave a sigh, and sadly smile
And lie a while in bed

I wish that it might come to pass
Not fade like all my dreams
Just think of what my life might be
In a world like I have seen

I don't think I can carry on
This cold and empty life
My spirits are low in the depths of despair
My lifeblood
Spills over..

I got no cobweb on my shoe
Standing on the moon
I'm feeling so alone and blue
I see the Gulf of Mexico
As tiny as a tear
The coast of California
Must be somewhere over here - over here
[Chorus]
Standing on the moon
I see the battle rage below
Standing on the moon
I see the soldiers come and go
There's a metal flag beside me
Someone planted long ago
Old Glory standing stiffly, Crimson, white and indigo [x2]
Indigo
[Verse 2]
I see all of Southeast Asia
I can see El Salvador
I hear the cries of children
And the other songs of war
It's like a mighty melody
That rings down from the sky
Standing here upon the moon
I watch it all roll by - all roll by
All roll by [x2]
[Chorus]
Standing on the moon
With nothing else to do
A lovely view of heaven
But I'd rather be with you
Standing on the moon
I see a shadow on the sun
Standing on the moon
The stars go fading one by one
I hear a cry of victory
And another of defeat
A scrap of age-old lullaby
Down some forgotten street
Standing on the moon
Where talk is cheap and vision true
Standing on the moon
But I would rather be with you
Somewhere in San Francisco
On a back porch in July
Just looking up to heaven
At this crescent in the sky
Standing on the moon
With nothing left to do
A lovely view of heaven
But I'd rather be with you - be with you",2846324,en,en,en
Saving Command,rock,Riverside Crow,2020,6,{},"A wall of blinking lights, reflected in a pair of glasses
A man staring at a screen, observing the fate of the masses
The crawling dots on the map multiply, the spreading out unimpeded
The execution of a saving command is needed desperately

Every minute there's a red light's flash, an alert for a catastrophe
Punching buttons, flipping switches and turning wheels, he saves them restlessly
The crawling dots on the enormous map multiply, the spreading out unimpeded
The execution of a saving command is prohibited but badly needed

Hitting an all-time low
Digits are crashing through the floor, never before has it been this bad
Another great depression
And they keep spreading like disease. What they really need is a  cold reset

A wall of red light's flashing, machinery overheated
A man is staring at an error screen, all contingency plans defeated
Punching buttons, flipping switches and turning wheels restlessly
With panic in his eyes, sweat on his brow, he succumbs to the emergencies

Hitting an all-time low
Digits are crashing through the floor, never before has it been this bad
Another great depression
And it keeps spreading like disease. What he really needs is a cold reset
A cold reset
Reset

A man hits the bottom, hits the red button, nothing's worth saving
The execution triggered turns off the lights, the reflection in the glasses fading",5991752,en,en,en

I’m not alright

You gave me hell but packaged it as paradise

I’m barely there at all
Don’t recognise my face
Am I still sane

King since 1992, over night I think I popped up out the blue
Think you cold but boy I'm sicker than the flu
I had a homie had to kick em out the loop
Seen better, endeavors, then tell her, it's a vibe
Gota get up out the crew, big waves when you get up in the Stu
I swear to God I got some funds I should recoup
Stoop kid I ain't afraid to leave the stoop
One juke, big boot, lil pook ain't near me
Swear to God everybody gona hear me
I got fire in my vеins they nestle
Pеople say the same ain't special People hate but they ain't slang they pebble, ain't the Same dang level
Anybody lame they revel
If they was at, where I'm at they'd settle
I'm passionate, anything less then I ain't having it
They make it to the top, and ain't grabbing it
I swear to God I'm adamant
Bout living not just getting what I need
God told me I would make it, just believe, now I see
Here's the roll out, I'm packing up
I'll leave my baggage at my old house
And everybody on insta for my know abouts
And ain't nobody hitting Shawnie he don't know bout
Big wheels, chromed out, they been in my home town bussing
I been in my own house fussing, bout winning there ain't no Malfunction, they ain't on Adjunction
Type of people have the whole class flunking
Might pull up with the whole class function and stunt
In the back of the class, now I'm sitting at the front
Big chain, big rang, used to getting what I want
Man I'm so fly they knew in 1991, I ain't even Gota front
I'm talking bout big chains, big wheels
Pockets on R Jam3z, big zeal
I be on big thangs, big meals
Ain't hearing what I been saying ima big deal
I be on new thangs
And I'm reading out the Luke James
And I finally got a boo thang
Calling on the phone and they say they tryna hear it already
Knowing Gritz done engendered it already
Baby I'm about to stunt

Hold up I think they know I'm nice
They got a rap career, they need to stick that boy in rice
And they just dropped Another single
And I think they played it twice
But I be on chill mode bout it
Shaky but I still don't doubt it
Know I'm walking like I'm Bilbo bout it
I been low touted, I ain't hating there ain't been no pouting
Praise God know I'm still gone shout it
Boy I'm talking To my pastor, got the reverend involved
Tryna stay away from vain but know I'm fresher than y'all
Ain't nobody really rapping, all they guns be steady clapping
Try to stay away from beef but know I'm the next in the yard
Next with the sauce, Young Shawnie got more chip than the dip
Ain't nobody ever heard me have no quit on my lip
I swear to God I'ma pull up to the dealership clean
Sow a seed there if you know I mean
Cause ima just stunt
In the back of the class, now I'm sitting at the front

Love is worst drug & you know them drugs ain't nothing to brag about
That's really why single life is the best life
Cause that shit have you passing out

Forgiving me when I fucked up

Cause the feeling was tough

Lemme lick it & eat that shit up
Ima show you wassup

To be honest really ian really feeling
All this reminiscing be in my position
You the one im missing

Youn see it how i fucking see it don't nobody get it
Still whippin up, hella beats cookin in da kitchen

But chu always think a nigga fucking wit some bitches (I ain't fuckin wit hoes)

Acting like groupies at all of my shows

Thats When It Hit Me,rock,Ezra Furman,2013,2277,{},"That's when it hit me and shattered my collar bone
I was in love with your world and the way you shoved it down my throat
I was bleeding just a little from the cut near my eyebrow
I wanted to tell ya that I loved you but I just couldn't figure out how

That's when it hit me
That's when it hit me: right now

My mouth fell open at the sight of a violent beauty
I was drooling sweet liquid on the carpet when you cut right through me
My eyes were black when you threw me against the wooden door
I was head over heels, I thought I couldn't take any more

Oh but that's when it hit me
That's when it hit me once more

And I was bleeding in the bed sheets, when we said good night
And I was touching a black and yellow bruise on my thigh
I was running on empty, the big bad sun started to rise

Well, that's when it hit
That's when it hit me, aye aye
I think it's clear, oh darling
That it hurts to split open my
Deep deep sleep at 2:30 in the morning
But you broke into my heart
And you gave me no warning
You're a heart attack
And I'm a dead man walking

When you went to sleep
I stayed up starin' at the ceiling
And I want the real thing
With no sugar coating
And no fine print
Just a real wild feeling
And I'm hittin' the floor
I'm rockin' and a reelin' for you
For you

That's when it hit me
That's when it hit me straight and true
That's when it hit me
Oh, it hit me straight and true",289730,en,en,en

So baby come and take me home
Come and mend this broken heart

Something tells me you don’t want to
And I guess this love ain't true
Almost feels like a nightmare
That our love is hanging by a thread or a hair

I ain't never trust nobody
But I rеally need somebody

I ain't never love my body
I ain't never trust my body
So I can't let nobody
See me loose

So and so's come and go
Don't matter the name always the same
Moment they see me weak i'm running away

Riding a wave
Body a stage
Anything to convince my fanbase i’m doing okay
Lowkey I’ losing my strength

I am a foe
I am a fake
I am a fuckboy

Knock it out the park when niggas push the real boss

Gotta to phase away and now the police stick the body to you
First 48 gotta keep your lips sealed

Became a blackened match
I held it to my eyes
And the flame of life
Reappeared at its tip

And as i held it to the light
It became as brilliant
As the sun of reality
Where-upon
I was turned by some unseen force
To face an ancient oriental man
Who said

“this is the beginning of the end
This is the war to end wars
This is the time when humankind
Will achieve their grеatest point
Of spiritual maturity
And the true birth of thе new millennium
Will have
Begun”
So indeed beneath me
I saw a huge city rise
At a right angle to my dimension
And on refocusing my vision
I saw it emerged from
A hole in the ground
From where it had been hidden so long

I watched this ancient secret
Spring to life in one second
With all its twenty first century technology
And i was outside of earths time
Joyous at earths excellent balance

I'm asking you why, oh why can't we be together?
Cuz' I really don't understand
And you could go cry and cry on forever
I really don't understand
You and me

Met her in a daze we through associations
Drunk for a week, we had a broken conversation
Left with a kiss and was off in that night
But that next night was ours girl, ha, (you and me)
Ever since then I can't kick that addiction
First few months I overlooked those afflictions
Punch drunk love, a drug so intense
Memories burn, the memories left me incensed
I ask myself, Why, Why, Why, Why can't we be happy
Look girl, I really don't understand
Can't forget the first night, cab ride home
Made love until first light
Next to you
Cuz' paradise was that bedroom
OJ and Tequila like girl I would wed you
You above all, love and health
I gave you everything and you nearly killed myself
[Hook: Repeat]

Months went by and addiction got worser
Lines got crossed, leighways went further
Trust digressed and the focus moved to old freaks
And all of a sudden, she was getting cold feet
I could tell but she wouldn't admit it
Caught somewhere in between love and me and her quittin'
Tried my hardest to change things that I couldn't see
Because all I ever wanted in the end was (you and me)
Plus she in school with a new band of friends
And that time in between that I knew I couldn't spend
Double standards had me going out my mind
She was texting her ex and I wasn't texting mine
Didn't end till' I walked in that night
Dudes hand on her hips, tough to avoid that fight
The ride home she slept, and I tried but I couldn't
Damn...I swear a piece of me died that night

[Hook: Repeat]

Took you out to lunch and I was starting to see more
I dried those eyes in the car by the seashore
Told me to drive while you laid in my lap
Made love all day, I laid awake and you napped
I thought for sure I had found what I needed
You needed me and in turn doubt was defeated
I was so happy, ignored questions that lingered
Instead I focused on a future and a ring on your finger
That was on me because I was still reeling
But I was too afraid, to say how I was feeling
You held the power for the words I'd never say
Because you had threatened to take everything away
Couldn't believe it and I couldn't believe you
How could you think I was out to deceive you?
Worst part is I still think about forever
And about why
Why can't we be

But this shit is worst than I recall, I'm so appalled
I had to get involved,rap fell off ,instead of evolved
The problem may never be solved, but I have the resolve
To see it threw to the end, my guts,nuts,and pen
While they politic pretend, and being stupid is a trend
Like I care how much you spend, when you owe the label in end
You bore me, claim boss but your an employee
But that's another story, I'm headed for the glory

These rappers are old news, I'm trying make mo moves
Doin' what I'm 'pose to, nothing can hold dude
Lookin' fly when I stroll threw,I dun told you
They don't come close to and they never will
With every song my legend builds forever ill

I never get enough sleep. I stay up late at night, cause I'm Night Guy. Night Guy wants to stay up late. 'What about getting up after five hours sleep?', oh that's Morning Guy's problem. That's not my problem, I'm Night Guy. I stay up as late as I want. So you get up in the morning, you're alarm, you're exhausted, groggy, oooh you hate that Night Guy! See, Night Guy always screws Morning Guy. There's nothing Morning Guy can do. The only thing Morning Guy can do is try and oversleep often enough so that Day Guy looses his job and Night Guy has no money to go out anymore.

JERRY'S APARTMENT

Elaine and Jerry hang out the window

ELAINE: Do you ever spit on anybody from here?

JERRY: No. You?

ELAINE: No. Do you ever think about it?

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: Me too.

Kramer enters the apartment

KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Well I got it!

JERRY: You got me the air conditioner?

KRAMER: What do you think?

JERRY: Beautiful!

ELAINE: What air conditioner?

KRAMER: Well my buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off.

JERRY: Is it a good one?

KRAMER: Good one? It's the Commando 8.

JERRY: Commando 8?

KRAMER: 12,000 BTU's.

ELAINE: I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.

KRAMER: Yeah, but Amy likes air conditioning.
ELAINE: Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy. (In a wining voice:) Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot.

JERRY: All right.

KRAMER: Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: Yeah. (George enters the apartment wearing goggles) Yeah, rock on!

Kramer leaves the apartment

GEORGE: I gotta get out of this city.

JERRY: So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth? (Elaine laughs silently)

GEORGE: I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?

ELAINE: You don't have an old pair?

GEORGE: I broke 'em playing basketball.

JERRY: He was running from a bee. (Elaine laughs)

GEORGE: Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.
ELAINE: George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool?

JERRY: There's a lot of change down there.

GEORGE: When I find that guy, this much I vow: those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner.

JERRY: We're behind you, Aquaboy. Godspeed!

Kramer enters the apartment

GEORGE: What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?

ELAINE: Yeah, especially those frames.

KRAMER: You know what you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical on Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.

GEORGE: Yeah, come on.

JERRY: Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner.

GEORGE: Really?

KRAMER: Retail is for suckers.

GEORGE: Wow. Uh, what do I have to do?

KRAMER: You just gotta mention my name.

GEORGE: That's it?

KRAMER: That's it. (smacks George on the forehead with a ruler)

J & T OPTICAL

George tries on a pair of glasses

GEORGE: What about these?

ELAINE: They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them.

GEORGE: Well, it's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.

JERRY: (bored) Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it.

George tries on some black glasses whose frames are OVERLY large

ELAINE: Now those look good, they're very bold.

Elaine begs George behind his back to pick a frame

GEORGE: Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?

JERRY: (While looking at posters of women wearing glasses) I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.

A man with a dog enters the store

ELAINE: Hi there, little doggy. (to owner:) Do you mind if I pet your dog?

DOG OWNER: It's okay with me.

ELAINE: Hey little doggy. (Elaine pets the dog and he bites her) Aaah!

DWAYNE: Hey, you can't have that dog in here.

The man leaves the store taking his dog with him

JERRY: Are you okay? Did he bite ya?

GEORGE: Can you believe that guy?

ELAINE: I'm okay, it's just a nip.

GEORGE: He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little man. Well not this time! (George leaves the store and follows the dog owner) You! Dog man!

George, without his glasses, squints and it looks like he sees something interesting. He enters the store again

ELAINE: My leg looks pretty bad.

JERRY: Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.

ELAINE: Okay.

JERRY: (To George:) Hey, any luck? Did you catch 'em?

GEORGE: Uuh, no, no.

JERRY: All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital.

GEORGE: (In a really strange way) Good, good, do that.

JERRY: What's the matter?

GEORGE: Oh, no, nothing.

JERRY: What is it?

GEORGE: I can't tell you.

ELAINE: (pulling on Jerry's pants from the ground) Jerry, can we go?

JERRY: Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. (And to George:) What do you mean you can't tell me?

GEORGE: I can't tell you, don't ask.

JERRY: I'm asking!

ELAINE: Jerry, my leg.

JERRY: Yeah, yeah, take care of it. (Jerry throws her some toilet paper) Come on, George, what is it?

GEORGE: I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: They were right outside!

JERRY: Amy and Jeffrey?

GEORGE: Yes!

JERRY: Are you sure?

GEORGE: Yes, positive.

JERRY: But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.

GEORGE: I know! I was squinting.

ELAINE: Okay, listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood.

JERRY: We're gonna have to talk about this later. (Elaine holds the door open for Jerry while holding her leg) Thank you. Taxi!

Jerry and Elaine leave the store; George tries on another pair of glasses

GEORGE: (To the store owner:) Excuse me, what do you think of these?

DWAYNE: Oh, we just got those in. It's a very exciting new frame.

GEORGE: Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face.

DWAYNE: All right, do you have a prescription?

GEORGE: Yeah. (George hands over the prescription) Kramer

DWAYNE: What?

GEORGE: Kramer

DWAYNE: What about him?

GEORGE: You do know Kramer?

DWAYNE: Yes

GEORGE: Well, I'm mentioning his name.

DWAYNE: Why?

GEORGE: Because you know

DWAYNE: No, I don't know. Look, I'm gonna need a deposit on these.

HOSPITAL

Elaine and Jerry are at the hospital; Elaine's wound is being fixed up by a foreign doctor

ELAINE: Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!

JERRY: Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department.

ELAINE: Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!

JERRY: But he was squinting.

ELAINE: So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.

JERRY: Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!

DOCTER: Okay.

ELAINE: Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?

DOCTER: Not shot, dog bite.

ELAINE: No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?

DOCTER: Not shot, dog bite. Woof woof, not bang bang.

the doctor exits the hospital room; Jerry and Elaine are shocked

JERRY'S APARTMENT

Jerry and Amy watch television

JERRY: Nah, look at this. Cable's out.

AMY: Oh that's okay, we don't have to watch tv.

JERRY: No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing. (Jerry picks up the phone and dials the number) I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?

AMY: Yesterday?

JERRY: Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day good day to be out.

AMY: I didn't do anything.

JERRY: (laughing) Oh you must have done something.

AMY: No, nothing really.

JERRY: Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk on Columbus Avenue?

AMY: Well, I did go out for a little while.

JERRY: Well, your day's getting more interesting already. (Jerry shows the phone) Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied.

AMY: You can't thrust anyone.

JERRY: No you can't. (hangs up the phone) Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?

AMY: What are you talking about?

JERRY: Look, my friend saw you.

AMY: Saw me? With who?

JERRY: You tell me.

AMY: There's nothing to tell.

JERRY: There isn't?

AMY: No.

JERRY: Oh all right wanna get some pizza?

Amy stands up and walks away

AMY: I had a feeling this was to good to be true.

JERRY: Why?

AMY: I knew there had to be another side to you.

JERRY: No, no, there's no side!

AMY: There is a side, an ugly side.

JERRY: No, no, no ugly side.

AMY: Look, I think I'm gonna go.

JERRY: Why?

AMY: It's really hot in here.

JERRY: Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?

AMY: Yeah. When you getting an air conditioner?

JERRY: It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.

JERRY'S APARTMENT

JERRY: I was an idiot for listening to you!

GEORGE: Hey, I saw what I saw.

JERRY: Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side.

GEORGE: What side?

JERRY: A bad side, an ugly side.

GEORGE: Ooh, so what?

JERRY: So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.

GEORGE: Why don't you just ask Jeffrey?

JERRY: Ah, he'd just deny it.

GEORGE: There must be some way to find out.

JERRY: Amy said nothing happened.

GEORGE: What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!

JERRY: Yeah, but you're blind as a bat!

GEORGE: I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? (snapping his fingers) I was spotting those raccoons.

JERRY: They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.

GEORGE: (noticing something) Hey look, a dime.

George walks over to the other end of the room and picks up a dime

GEORGE: Heh, Mercury head. You mind?

JERRY: (Stunned:) No, keep it. (Elaine enters the apartment) Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.

ELAINE: There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.

JERRY: A little white dog?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: Snowball? You were afraid of Snowball?

ELAINE: I'm afraid of dogs now.

JERRY: He's like a squirrel.

ELAINE: Well he frightened me.

GEORGE: Did you get the shot?

ELAINE: No. He said I didn't need a shot.

GEORGE: You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?

ELAINE: What, you think I should have?

George indicates 'yes'

JERRY: You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.

ELAINE: All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.

Kramer enters the apartment

KRAMER: The AC is on it's way.

GEORGE: Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne there was no discount.

KRAMER: What?

GEORGE: That's right, no discount!

KRAMER: Well did you mention my name?

GEORGE: Yes, I mentioned your name.

KRAMER: And?

GEORGE: Pbbbs, Bubkis!

KRAMER: Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now.

GEORGE: All right, let me just I'm gonna grap an apple.

JERRY: Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball!

KRAMER: Little Snowball? He runs on batteries!

George takes a bite out of an onion

ELAINE: You know, George, that's an onion.

GEORGE: Yes it is.

And he takes another bite

ELAINE: He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?

GEORGE: I saw them making out, you can believe it.

JERRY: I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.

KRAMER: Look, all you gotta to do, is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it.

JERRY: Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.

KRAMER: Right this way, mister Doody!

GEORGE: (crying from the onion) You'll see I'm right.

J & T OPTICAL

KRAMER: Hey, Dwayny.

DWAYNE: Oh hello Kramer.

KRAMER: What is going on here?

DWAYNE: What are you talking about?

KRAMER: I'm talking about the thirty percent discount.

ELAINE: Uhm excuse me uh a man came in here

GEORGE: Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something.

DWAYNE: Who said anything about a discount.

KRAMER: Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy.

DWAYNE: For what?

Kramer pulls out a candy bar

KRAMER: Remember this?

DWAYNE: What are you doing?

KRAMER: Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?

DWAYNE: Put that away!

KRAMER: Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all *hopped* up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuffin' cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude yeah, yeah, yeah!

DWAYNE: All right, all right, all right! I'll give him the discount, just put that thing away! This squares us.

ELAINE: Can I just have the name

DWAYNE: Out!

KRAMER: We'll see you Dwayne.

JERRY: (To George:) Who picked these out?

GEORGE: I did!

JERRY: They're ladies' glasses! You know all you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.

GEORGE: Well Elaine was supposed to help me.

Elaine runs over to George and starts screaming

ELAINE: Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!

JERRY: Take it to the window.

KRAMER: 12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power. (Kramer places the air conditioner in the window) Installed!

GEORGE: That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?

KRAMER: No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest. (And to Jerry:) I'll seal that up later, right?

JERRY: Just in time for Amy.

GEORGE: Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plan?

ELAINE: I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!

KRAMER: Of what?

JERRY: Rabies.

KRAMER: Oh that's fatal, you don't want that!

Elaine runs over to Kramer and starts screaming again

ELAINE: I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!

JERRY: Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?

ELAINE: I'm sorry, Kramer, I'm sorry.

KRAMER: No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once. (George's eating chips) May I have one of those, madam?

GEORGE: Madam? What are you calling me madam for?

KRAMER: They're ladies' glasses.

Kramer takes George's glasses and shows him the inside

JERRY: He does look like a horse.

ELAINE: Yeah, he's got a real horse face. (Elaine, while looking out the window:) Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! (She opens the window and screams:) Hey! Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!

DOG OWNER: Hey who are you calling stupid?

JERRY: Hey, shall we spit on him?

ELAINE: No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.

George puts on his glasses again and sees it's a policewoman kissing a horse; realizing this George's reaction says ""I stand corrected""

NEW YORK HEALTH CLUB LOCKER ROOM

George and Jerry after a workout

JERRY: I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I had to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.

While Jerry goes to tie his shoes George nods his head knowing it was him

GEORGE: Yeah. Hmm. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses

The camera shows George's glasses on top of his locker

CLOSING MONOLOGUE

But I wanna know, when did glasses go from being this carefully crafted medical apparatus to just this mall impulse item? 'Honey, I'm going out for a yogurt and a pair of trifocals do you need anything?' It's always glasses in about an hour. How much are they? 75 bucks. Well here's 72 and that's about 75 ok? Oh are you trying to coordinate it with the one hour photo place, is that the idea? 'Oh yea give me the glasses, my pictures are coming out right now I need to see 'em.' A then they have those Woolworth glasses you know. They're there, they're there now. No eye examine you don't have any idea what is wrong with your eyes and the glasses are made up they are ready and waiting so you can just walk in, 'thank you, bye.' And just walk right into a wall. Bang.

With a sword in your hand and your homeland to save

‘The day that I was born, she said, The Good Lord woke from slumber
Looking ‘round his timber yard, He found He had no lumber
Apart from some old twisted branch, in shadows left to lurk
He pulled it out into the light and set about his work.’

She told me that the world should not expect too much of me
When the Good Lord carved my crooked soul, out of a crooked tree
When the Good Lord carved my crooked soul, out of a crooked tree.”

Making Cider,misc,Vita Sackville-West,2016,2,{},"I saw within the wheelwright’s shed
The big round cartwheels, blue and red;
A plough with blunted share;
A blue tin jug; a broken chair;
And paint in trial patchwork square
Slapping up against the wall;
The lumber of the wheelwright’s trade,
And tools on benches neatly laid,
The brace, the adze, the awl;

And framed within the latticed-panes,
Above the cluttered sill,
Saw rooks upon the stubble hill
Seeking forgotten grains;

And all the air was sweet and shrill
With juice of apples heaped in skips,
Fermenting, rotten, soft and bruise,
And all the yard was strewn with pips,
Discarded pulp, and wrung-out ooze
That ducks with rummaging flat bill
Searched through beside the cider-press
To gobble in their greediness.
The young men strained upon the crank
To wring the last reluctant inch.
They laughed together, fair and frank,
And threw their loins across the winch.

A holiday from field and dung,
From plough and harrow, scythe and spade,
To dabble in another trade,
The crush the pippins in the slats,
And see that in the little vats
An extra pint was wring;
While round about the worthies stood
Profuse in comment, praise or blame,
Content the press should be of wood,
Advising rum, decrying wheat,
And black strong sugar makes it sweet,
But still resolved, with maundering tongue,
That cider could not be the same
As once when they were young;
But still the young contemptuous men
Laughed kindly at their old conceit,
And strained upon the crank again.

Now barrels ranged in portly line
Mature through winter’s sleep,
Aping the leisured sloths of wine
That dreams of Tiber or the Rhine,
Mellowing slow and deep;
But keen and cold the northern nights
Sharpen the quiet yard.
And sharp like no rich southern wine
The tang of cider bites;
For here the splintered stars and hard
Hold England in a frosty guard.
Orion and Pleiades
Above the wheelwright’s shed.
And Sirius resting on the trees
While all the village snores abed.",2895207,en,en,en

Cabeza de Vacas Adventures in the Unknown Interior of America Chap. 18,misc,Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca,2013,19,"{""Cyclone Covey""}","What Befell Oviedo with the Indians

AFTER WE ATE, I ordered Lope de Oviedo, our strongest man, to climb one of the trees not far off and ascertain the lay of the land. He complied and found out from the treetop that we were on an island. [This was Galveston Island.] He also said that the ground looked as if cattle had trampled it and therefore that this must be a country of Christians.

I sent him back for a closer look, to see if he could find any worn trails, but warned him not to risk going too far. He went and came upon a path which he followed for half a league to some empty huts. The Indians were gone to shoal-flats [to dig rootsj. He took an earthen pot, a little dog, and a few mullets and started back.

We had begun to worry what might have happened to him, so I detailed another two men to check. They met him shortly and saw three Indians with bows and arrows following him. The Indians were calling to him and he was gesturing them to keep coming. When he reached us, the Indians held back and sat down on the shore.

Half an hour later a hundred bowmen [Joint Report: 200, with joints of cane stuck through holes in their ears] reinforced the first three individuals. Whatever their stature, they looked like giants to us in our fright. We could not hope to defend ourselves; not half a dozen of us could even stand up.

The Inspector and I walked out and greeted them. They advanced, and we did our best to placate and ingratiate. We gave them beads and bells, and each one of them gave us an arrow in pledge of friendship. They told us by signs that they would return at sunrise and bring food, having none then.",188034,en,en,en

Bad Terms,rock,Hollywood (UK),2020,15,{},"[VERSE 1]

I didn’t want us to end on bad terms, but I had no other option
I just saw that today’s the expiry date on our love potion
You forced my hand to reveal the words I wanted to leave unspoken
And now we’re back in a place believing we’re full of such loathing

That we never want to speak again and exist in the same reality
I’ve been wide awake since October, and now I’m finally ready to sleep
On a life I thought was brewing for us underneath the surface
But tonight it became apparent that our love was unrequited

[PRE-Chorus]

What did I do to make your feelings disappear?
(Was it too much again? Were you too full of fear?)
Friendship is off the table, we now exists as strangers
(Memories rest high on the shelf, never touched again)

[Chorus]
I told you that night “well at least you got an album...
So I suppose that you have won, but don’t expect another”
I know I wasn’t used by you to piggyback my attention
This is the last song I’ll write, go be happy with another

I hope you get your fairytale or your silver screen moment
With someone who understands you and doesn’t even bother
To make petty jokes for the sake of winning an argument
It’s hit me how much we don’t work, we’re better off without each other

[VERSE 2]

I didn’t want to end on bad terms but I had no other option
I could have left this all unsaid, but would I live to regret that?
I would have given you the world if I ever had the chance
But unrequited is this feeling, you’ll never give me another glance

I told you I never felt like a priority in your life
That still rings true, even second or third wasn’t mine
I felt like your last choice, when you had no other option
An empty triangle as red as my heart as it’s bleeding

[VERSE 3]

I didn’t want to end on bad terms, but I had no other option
I’ve ran out of love to give, I really thought that we connected
But perhaps we had a spark that fizzled out in an instant
Now I’ll sue the universe
I’ll sue the universe
I said to all my friends
When we started I knew we’d end on bad terms",5493794,en,en,en

This is my story
How much pain is in my life and how much happinessssss
Some good things  and some bad things


Verse 1
Today I tell you all my sorrows
Im sad boy i always keep thinking about career
There is no sleep for the whole night because of career
Only career wondering in the mind i dont sleep because of career
And im not able to do any work because of career
Sometime i go out to play games with my friends but i feel sad about what will happen in my life
Iam always stressed i always think what will happen in my life
I always tell everyone that i worried but who cares everyone think im jocking
Everyone say why do you keep sad but what do they know about how painful in my lifе
No one can understand how much pain is in my life
Many difficultiеs come in my life but i never give up
And i never asked anyone for help
Because i know no one have time for me i know that if i ask for help
From these people then they will pretend that they are busy
Thats why i never asked help from them
And i learn to face all the problems alone
I know my durga mother with me as many problems come in my life  i will face it alone
And i will never beg in front of anyone for fame whatever happens
I do not want to beg anyone for fame like a beggar
Chorus 1


This is all about my life
And some my hard work and some my life style
And if you feel bad then abuse me
As much as you want i know some people hate then tell me
What i take from these people

Verse 2

I did not have the money to buy some good stuff and i have to suffer a lot for my life
I had to work very hard for my life
I never give you always worked hard to make my life beautiful
I do my work i dont know why people are suffering from me
I always thought that i would have good things but i had many problem in my life at that time
I never asked my senior to take anything
I had already thought that if i want to take anything so only on my hard work
Always thought that good days will come always believe in durga mother thats why i did a lot today
And some people think that if they dont help in bad times then i won't be able to do anything
Forget my people i know how to work alone and i dont need your help
I have already been working alone
And if you are thinking that i cannot do anything without you then this is your dream
I know some people are jealous with me alot but still i dont care
Because these people do not do any work on thier own just after seeing the work of other they come to speak bad
What do they know how hard i have worked and you guys are laughing at my work
If you guys worked hard at my age then you know what hard work is
I know you guys can't work hard at my age
Because you always enjoy with you parents money i sware you have never been able to work you will start crying if you work hard at my age

From the age of 17 i started making songs to brighten my future
And i work a lot but nobody listen to my songs and does not support me
Everyone thinks that i make unnecessary songs but they dont know that i do everything by myself
Because i dont have the money to go to the studio and make songs
Nobody is listening to my songs
Everyone thinks im just talking non sense nobody wants to support me no problem i will keep working hard whatever happens
I dont care i will keep making songs
And i dont even care what people say after listen to my songs
I dont care a little bit and as your wise if you want to listen then listen
If you dont want to listen then dont listen
And i am telling you first that i will not come in front of you for begging to hear my songs
Everyday i write songs and i have no shortage of lyrics and your thinking that if you do not listen to my songs
Then i will stop making songs
I will never stop making songs and i dont think much about
It whether  people like my songs
Or not and i dont even care about it i know im sad boy and i never want to take anyone to help me for write songs
Everyday i write song alone and i dont need anyone help
Some of my friends that i copy lyrics
I know that all these cannot write like me
Thats why they all laugh after listening to my songs all the time they are jealous of me
Because i know how to write a song and they dont know
Outro

This is all about my life
And some my hard work and some my life style
And if you feel bad then abuse me
As much as you want i know some people hate then tell me
What i take from these people",6862926,en,en,en

I ride when I walk I sleep where I want
I seek out the peasants that wanna get tough

Fight me and go steal all my gold

That’s not enough? Let me go die
Jump off a building and keeping you guessing

Suck all you haters who begged for my grind
I’ll die when I want I’ll never be fine

I'm so sick and tired
I'm done crying at night it's tough
I feel like my life is done
Don’t forget who helped you bruh
I’m just done I might not breathe
Killed my conscious feel like T
Living for what? It feels like a dream
Been trying so hard I just wanna see

Wanna see what you accomplished from this
I'm lying down here with my wrist on the sink
The rage that you brought I'm feeling so sick
I wanna say fuck you I'm leaving these hints
I’m sorry you hate me move on from this shit
You wanted me dead that’s all that you’ll get
That’s 3 for the M, not _ and friends
Regretting the days I met all you fakes
I’ll fly to the top avoiding the raid
Spraying the poison won’t ever be great
I’m living this sober life leaving you feens
Leaving my past behind fuck do you need?
I got my _ I got my needs
Family coming first fuck all the green
I wish you the best I want you to see
I'm changing myself for myself just for me

Let's take it all back for a minute
Writing 16s for a minute
Been indecisive with my writtens
Being over-sentimental for the critics
Felt like i'm the underdog for days
I just want to pave my wave
Manifesting moves in my state
Leading SOT to light the way

[VERSE]
Took a moment finding out where my heart lies
Seeking out my living purpose through my mind's sights
Soul searching through the Colorado skylines
I realized what I was missing out the whole time
Through endless trays of indica on summer nights
And alcohol fueled talks with some like minds
I realized I wasn't satisfied
Satisfied with who I was within my birthright
Frustration held me back
I took it out regrettably in the past
On people that held me up and all of it faded fast
My ego kept me afloat but nigga, that couldn't last
Real talk cause I know a guy
With true ambition and we came up on an enterprise
He'll hear this verse so I hope this got him energized
You'll be a legend, stop your claiming thinking otherwise

[VERSE]
Did my thing on the daily
Spending 4 years working with my patience
Wrote for hours in a basement
Working 2 jobs, practiced on my break shifts
Knew I truly had to make it
Cause my songs helped so many through the daily
Fucked around with the ladies
And they was gassing me to quit being lazy
Realizing what I really want
A mothafucka had to picture that he was a boss
With making beats like i'm Ye while his running's hot
I had to center on the goal of why it's paying off
Spent my teenage years trying to build it up
Self doubt was the enemy to fuck it up
While wasting time with opinions of the fakest bunch
But that helped me down the line, as i'm growing up
Saw the game moving fast now
Questioned if I really belong now
Yet I couldn't falter back down
Arrogance inside had me losing sanity as I lost count
My environment laid my life out
But luckily, I was conscious to never fade into pressure
Self control was prevalent holding it altogether
Now I found myself

Sunsets in place

Dopest Birthday,rap,Theadamsmasher (TOLS),2020,5,{},"[Intro: Theadamsmasher (TOLS)]
Check, check

[Verse 1: Theadamsmasher (TOLS)]
Today I'm 22, still stuck in transition
Every day is a new challenge to get a better position
In my day job, sticking with that higher ambition
But my mundane routine keeps distracting from my mission

Pulling from my hobbies, it's been two years straight
My career is in the lobby, still ain't move weight
Its OK, I got patience, I will never ever flake
You can go ahead and doubt but you'll pay for your mistakes

It's fate, make no mistake, I know you can't relate
I've been bumping to the rhymes since the tender age of 8
I was written like Nas, It Was Written like Nas
My destiny nowadays was scripted to be great, but wait

I just keep pushing my album back
Revisit my pen and pad and add another track
I always find more to add, I add another track
But it's OK brother's just give me some slack
My energy is divided, my budget keeps subtracting
But I multiplied my message for the masses, do the math
Come equipt with a verbal clip, I never slip, shooting from the hip
Watch em shiver and the quiver from my wrath

Still getting them chips, still getting them grades
Been working on my look, sporting aviator shades
Got a lot of people in my life, the lineup a parade
I still ain't find my habibti but that's perfectly OK

I just slide and keep it moving, you better get out my way
Cause My Arrival draws near with every passing day
I'm only halfway through college, steady staking higher knowledge
Got accepted to transfer all over the place

But tuition is a pain in my pocket, every year
My budget gets hit with the rocket and disappears
I still don't know which acceptance to take
But I'm not fretting cause I know that my vision is super clear

But enough with this blue tip, I'm back with this music
My unit is equipt and ready to outweigh
Ramadan is capeesh and I'm back on the track
With the quick fast raps, this my dopest birthday
Yah-yah
[Interlude 1: Theadamsmasher (TOLS)]
Uh, something light for y'all
Check, we gonna switch up to some freestyle right quick hold up
Lemme, lemme, lemme try to catch the beat
Uh

[Verse 2: Theadamsmasher (TOLS)]
This a 2pac instrumental, you know it
Everybody knows that I've been flowing and I grow it
Everybody knows that my skill, I tend to show it
Cause when I'm in the freestyle zone I never mow it

Like the grass on the lawn, I keep it in the thing
Like I'm Summer to the Dawn, I keep my own ring
I ain't basketball brawl, but I ain't like Lebron
I've been doing my own thing since I, pinky rings, hold up

I'm just messing up and this is how it sounds
Keep it profound, bumping that surround sound
Everybody knows I got me feet on the ground
But my hair-n-in the heaven and you know that I'm profound, hold up

I said that twice but I'm still too nice
Wrecking everything I do cause I got it like, POW
And everybody knows I do it right now
I'm 22 years old and I'm feeling real good
That's truth, everybody knows you in my neighborhood
Tell all my people that I will slide by with the drive by
Everybody knows I by pie, nah
I'm just really messing up, really what's good?

[Interlude 2: Theadamsmasher (TOLS)]
Aye, everybody wish your boy a happy birthday man
24th, it's not every day my birthday lines up with the last day of Ramadan
But, to all my people out there, we good
That album coming soon dawg
I just keep pushing it back cause I got more stuff to add, but it's good
Hold up, hold up

[Interlude 3: Theadamsmasher (TOLS)]
I've been talking too much, that's OK though
Everybody knows, but my name ain't Kato, everybody flows
I've been on the thing cause I've been getting that dough
No this ain't a written, this is off the top of the dome

I ain't popping that chrome but I carry two guns
On my left and right arm, I be knowing like a Nun
I be keeping it Halal, I be keeping it humble
Everybody knows that I'm straight out the jungle

From the concrete streets of the DMV
Everybody knows you don't, just mess with me
Adam in the booth I freestyle a whole day
Everybody knows I' after that big pay

I'm an engineer by profession
And if you every [irritate], I'm the illest in your section
Ain't a question, all-o-y'all best sit down
And I've been doing this cause I'm way, way profound, ha-ha

That'ts enough for today, I might freestyle any type-o-way
Got that gum in my mouth and I must say
I gotta cook dinner so that's enough for today

Ight for real,I gotta go cook dinner man
Enough messing with ya'll man

Time has come I will sing the sad goodbye song
When I was seventeen, I used to know you
And I haven't seen you now in so many years
And the last time I saw you
You said you joined the Church of Jesus
But me I remember your long red hair
Falling in our faces as I kissed you

I just want you to know I just had to go
I just want you to know I just had to grow
And you're probably married now
With a house and car and all
And you turned into a grown-up female stranger
If I was lyin' by you now, I wouldn't be here at all

Well we parted so hard
Me rushing 'round New York with a guitar
Making love to people I didn't even like to see
And I still sometimes think of you
As I lay here in the sick sad morning
And in the lonely midnight
I've got to hold your face before me
I just want you to know I just had to go
I just want you to know I just had to grow
And you're probably married now
With kids and all
And you turned into a grown-up female stranger
If I was lyin' by you now, I'd just have to fall

And I never slept with you
Though we must have made love a thousand times
'Cause we were just young
Didn't have no place to go

I just want you to know I just had to go
I just want you to know I just had to grow
So its goodbye First Love
And I hope you're fine

You deserve to never be offended
Never get in trouble girl, you never get suspended

You deserve a choir for anytime you feel like singing

I know it's fucking hard
Somehow you stay collected
If we was cards then you'd be holographic and protected
If we was kids again I'd pass a note that had a message
Talking about if you like me, check it (word?)
Is you is? Or is you ain't?

The world lost a luminary recently
It's name Hip Hop
And it drowned from to much **** and champagne
What the hell happened to you Hip Hop
Artist with names like, Terminator X and
Furious Five And Ni**as With Attitude(NWA)
Once preached about social awareness
And political enlightenment
When did fight the power
Become ""Wait til you see my D***!"" (Laughs)

[Verse 1]

I started off in this game, heart full of high hopes
Young and naive, Notebook full of fly quotes
Critically acclaimed, they say Crooked I's dope
Doper than white coke, walking a tight rope
Trying not to fall, this industry you see it got traps
Record executives rape you with those paper contracts
Got my first deal and they pulled out my arteries
Shot me in the heart I mean they killed the best part of me
Ask me to be a gimmick shitting on my artistry
Ain't nobody hard as me! Fuck being RnB!
Told you crooked go hard, told you it’s a G thang
Told you fuck that auto-tune shit unless its T-pain!
I like Lil Wayne, cos he's Lil Wayne
I like the game cos he's game and we ain't the same
You need a little variety on your spice rack
AnR’s want me to change so I don’t like RAP!
Ask me for ringtone song homey I might snap!
And treat my automatic weapon to life snack!
A lot of rappers let it slide but I fight back
Cos 99% of hip hop is quite wack!
So you can hate me or get back on the right track
Either way I don’t give a fuck! and its like that
Yeah its like that, used to be a nice cat
Last year I was sick of this music now Im twice that!

Do you remember the first time
You heard P.E.?, NWA and B.D.P.?
Do you remember the last time

You ever hear
Big Pun and D.O.C
You ever hear

You like rappers in shoot-outs I really been through em
I swear to god I could have did the 50 cent to em!
A little guidance from Dre, let Jimmy mentor em!
Instead my enemies witnessed my semi spit for em
I could have did the Snoop, im from the beach homey
I could have did the Eminem
Im a beast homey!
Look at the word play I use in the chorus
The verse way, over your head I confuse a thesaurus
Im worth cake! Making moves in the torus
You smoke weed?
I got so many tree’s you’ll be abusing the forest
We serve weight
While executives in music ignore us
In the first place
Fuck! Fugitive warrants!
Id rather have a lucrative future in touring
On my first date stupid supporters
May I first state my news to reporters
Yo, ill call a press conference to say FUCK rap!
Then go to the radio station and let the GUN clap!
I spit like a hundred Kanye’s and 3000 Andre’s
Still im stuck HERE! Where the thugs at!
Magazine covers tell you were my buzz at
Everything you do to get a big deal I done that!

Yo
I give rap stars a blind folded cigarette
They kick me off they videos sets

Me and Suge parted ways along time ago
Didn’t think you labels would react so vagina though!

Lately, I've been thinkin' 'bout the past
Thinkin 'bout my old girls and why it didn't last
Cuz she said ""We'd be better as friends""
I think that's why it's hard for me to let new people in
Or maybe it's the fact that I'm so insecure
But I see someone different when I look in the mirror
I see a Drake, like the one who made ""Take Care"" and shit
But what's the success if you don't have someone to share with
Yeah, and girl I wanna share with ya
Yeah I had the vision, but you didn't see the picture
I was always shy, didn't think that I could get ya
Now I'm thinkin ""Should I hit you up?"" and tell ya that I missed you cuz
We never had sex, but we had a connection
Mama always told me boy to use protection
But she never warned me to go protect my heart

Off a couple shots, then you fell up in the bath tub?

I guess it wasn't meant to be

To see where I’m going
What I left behind
And I’m moving so slow
Don’t know when I’ll arrive

I set off for the shore
That was far and slipped away
From the ones I adored
And the place I was raised
And I rode down the road
Just to watch it go by
And when and where is love?
Maybe nowhere am I

Everyone needs a touch
Or a shoulder for crying
They say love is a crutch
I say love is blind
And that’s all that she needed
That I could not supply
When a bend in the road
Put it out of my mind
Then a strange little girl
Who was everything I ever dreamed
I could love or be loved by

So put a bridge or a hill
Or a forest of pines
Or a river of blue
I can run along side

I'll follow the signs

The Count of Monte Cristo Chap. 18,misc,"Alexandre Dumas, Pre",2016,33,"{""Alexandre Dumas / Père""}","                                        The Treasure

When Dantes returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity, he found Faria seated and looking composed. In the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell, he held open in his left hand, of which alone, it will be recollected, he retained the use, a sheet of paper, which, from being constantly rolled into a small compass, had the form of a cylinder, and was not easily kept open. He did not speak, but showed the paper to Dantes.

""What is that?"" he inquired.

""Look at it,"" said the abbe with a smile.

""I have looked at it with all possible attention,"" said Dantes, ""and I only see a half-burnt paper, on which are traces of Gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink.""

""This paper, my friend,"" said Faria, ""I may now avow to you, since I have the proof of your fidelity—this paper is my treasure, of which, from this day forth, one-half belongs to you.""

The sweat started forth on Dantes brow. Until this day and for how long a time!—he had refrained from talking of the treasure, which had brought upon the abbe the accusation of madness. With his instinctive delicacy Edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord, and Faria had been equally silent. He had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason; and now these few words uttered by Faria, after so painful a crisis, seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation.

""Your treasure?"" stammered Dantes. Faria smiled.

""Yes,"" said he. ""You have, indeed, a noble nature, Edmond, and I see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment. No, be assured, I am not mad. This treasure exists, Dantes, and if I have not been allowed to possess it, you will. Yes—you. No one would listen or believe me, because everyone thought me mad; but you, who must know that I am not, listen to me, and believe me so afterwards if you will.""

""Alas,"" murmured Edmond to himself, ""this is a terrible relapse! There was only this blow wanting."" Then he said aloud, ""My dear friend, your attack has, perhaps, fatigued you; had you not better repose awhile? To-morrow, if you will, I will hear your narrative; but to-day I wish to nurse you carefully. Besides,"" he said, ""a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about.""

""On the contrary, it is a matter of the utmost importance, Edmond!"" replied the old man. ""Who knows if to-morrow, or the next day after, the third attack may not come on? and then must not all be over? Yes, indeed, I have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches, which would make the wealth of a dozen families, will be forever lost to those men who persecute me. This idea was one of vengeance to me, and I tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity. But now I have forgiven the world for the love of you; now that I see you, young and with a promising future,—now that I think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure, I shudder at any delay, and tremble lest I should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth."" Edmond turned away his head with a sigh.
""You persist in your incredulity, Edmond,"" continued Faria. ""My words have not convinced you. I see you require proofs. Well, then, read this paper, which I have never shown to any one.""

""To-morrow, my dear friend,"" said Edmond, desirous of not yielding to the old man's madness. ""I thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until to-morrow.""

""Then we will not talk of it until to-morrow; but read this paper to-day.""

""I will not irritate him,"" thought Edmond, and taking the paper, of which half was wanting,—having been burnt, no doubt, by some accident,—he read:—

""This treasure, which may amount to two... of Roman crowns in the most distant a... of the second opening wh... declare to belong to him alo... heir. ""25th April, 149-""

""Well!"" said Faria, when the young man had finished reading it.

""Why,"" replied Dantes, ""I see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words, which are rendered illegible by fire.""

""Yes, to you, my friend, who read them for the first time; but not for me, who have grown pale over them by many nights' study, and have reconstructed every phrase, completed every thought.""

""And do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning?""

""I am sure I have, and you shall judge for yourself; but first listen to the history of this paper.""

""Silence!"" exclaimed Dantes. ""Steps approach—I go—adieu.""

And Dantes, happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to confirm his belief in his friend's mental instability, glided like a snake along the narrow passage; while Faria, restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity, pushed the stone into place with his foot, and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid discovery.

It was the governor, who, hearing of Faria's illness from the jailer, had come in person to see him.
Faria sat up to receive him, avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him with death. His fear was lest the governor, touched with pity, might order him to be removed to better quarters, and thus separate him from his young companion. But fortunately this was not the case, and the governor left him, convinced that the poor madman, for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection, was only troubled with a slight indisposition.

During this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands, tried to collect his scattered thoughts. Faria, since their first acquaintance, had been on all points so rational and logical, so wonderfully sagacious, in fact, that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with madness. Was Faria deceived as to his treasure, or was all the world deceived as to Faria?

Dantes remained in his cell all day, not daring to return to his friend, thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced, once for all, that the abbe was mad—such a conviction would be so terrible!

But, towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone by, Faria, not seeing the young man appear, tried to move and get over the distance which separated them. Edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his leg was inert, and he could no longer make use of one arm. Edmond was obliged to assist him, for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to Dantes' chamber.

""Here I am, pursuing you remorselessly,"" he said with a benignant smile. ""You thought to escape my munificence, but it is in vain. Listen to me.""

Edmond saw there was no escape, and placing the old man on his bed, he seated himself on the stool beside him.

""You know,"" said the abbe, ""that I was the secretary and intimate friend of Cardinal Spada, the last of the princes of that name. I owe to this worthy lord all the happiness I ever knew. He was not rich, although the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb, and I heard the phrase very often, 'As rich as a Spada.' But he, like public rumor, lived on this reputation for wealth; his palace was my paradise. I was tutor to his nephews, who are dead; and when he was alone in the world, I tried by absolute devotion to his will, to make up to him all he had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness. The cardinal's house had no secrets for me. I had often seen my noble patron annotating ancient volumes, and eagerly searching amongst dusty family manuscripts. One day when I was reproaching him for his unavailing searches, and deploring the prostration of mind that followed them, he looked at me, and, smiling bitterly, opened a volume relating to the History of the City of Rome. There, in the twentieth chapter of the Life of Pope Alexander VI., were the following lines, which I can never forget:—

""'The great wars of Romagna had ended; Caesar Borgia, who had completed his conquest, had need of money to purchase all Italy. The pope had also need of money to bring matters to an end with Louis XII. King of France, who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses; and it was necessary, therefore, to have recourse to some profitable scheme, which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of exhausted Italy. His holiness had an idea. He determined to make two cardinals.'

""By choosing two of the greatest personages of Rome, especially rich men—this was the return the holy father looked for. In the first place, he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held; and then he had the two hats to sell besides. There was a third point in view, which will appear hereafter. The pope and Caesar Borgia first found the two future cardinals; they were Giovanni Rospigliosi, who held four of the highest dignities of the Holy See, and Caesar Spada, one of the noblest and richest of the Roman nobility; both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope. They were ambitious, and Caesar Borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments. The result was, that Rospigliosi and Spada paid for being cardinals, and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation, and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the speculators.

""It is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation. The pope heaped attentions upon Rospigliosi and Spada, conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate, and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at Rome. Then the pope and Caesar Borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner. This was a matter of dispute between the holy father and his son. Caesar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends, that is to say, in the first place, the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard. This key was furnished with a small iron point,—a negligence on the part of the locksmith. When this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard, of which the lock was difficult, the person was pricked by this small point, and died next day. Then there was the ring with the lion's head, which Caesar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand. The lion bit the hand thus favored, and at the end of twenty-four hours, the bite was mortal. Caesar proposed to his father, that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard, or shake hands with them; but Alexander VI., replied: 'Now as to the worthy cardinals, Spada and Rospigliosi, let us ask both of them to dinner, something tells me that we shall get that money back. Besides, you forget, Caesar, an indigestion declares itself immediately, while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two.' Caesar gave way before such cogent reasoning, and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner.

""The table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope, near San Pierdarena, a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report. Rospigliosi, quite set up with his new dignities, went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner. Spada, a prudent man, and greatly attached to his only nephew, a young captain of the highest promise, took paper and pen, and made his will. He then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard; but it appeared the servant did not find him.

""Spada knew what these invitations meant; since Christianity, so eminently civilizing, had made progress in Rome, it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message, 'Caesar wills that you die.' but it was a legate a latere, who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope, 'His holiness requests you to dine with him.'

""Spada set out about two o'clock to San Pierdarena. The pope awaited him. The first sight that attracted the eyes of Spada was that of his nephew, in full costume, and Caesar Borgia paying him most marked attentions. Spada turned pale, as Caesar looked at him with an ironical air, which proved that he had anticipated all, and that the snare was well spread. They began dinner and Spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message. The nephew replied no; perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question. It was too late, for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine, placed for him expressly by the pope's butler. Spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him, which he was pressed to taste. An hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms. Spada died on the threshold of the vineyard; the nephew expired at his own door, making signs which his wife could not comprehend.
""Then Caesar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage, under presence of seeking for the papers of the dead man. But the inheritance consisted in this only, a scrap of paper on which Spada had written:—'I bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers, my books, and, amongst others, my breviary with the gold corners, which I beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle.'

""The heirs sought everywhere, admired the breviary, laid hands on the furniture, and were greatly astonished that Spada, the rich man, was really the most miserable of uncles—no treasures—unless they were those of science, contained in the library and laboratories. That was all. Caesar and his father searched, examined, scrutinized, but found nothing, or at least very little; not exceeding a few thousand crowns in plate, and about the same in ready money; but the nephew had time to say to his wife before he expired: 'Look well among my uncle's papers; there is a will.'

""They sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done, but it was fruitless. There were two palaces and a vineyard behind the Palatine Hill; but in these days landed property had not much value, and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son. Months and years rolled on. Alexander VI. died, poisoned,—you know by what mistake. Caesar, poisoned at the same time, escaped by shedding his skin like a snake; but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a tiger's. Then, compelled to quit Rome, he went and got himself obscurely killed in a night skirmish, scarcely noticed in history. After the pope's death and his son's exile, it was supposed that the Spada family would resume the splendid position they had held before the cardinal's time; but this was not the case. The Spadas remained in doubtful ease, a mystery hung over this dark affair, and the public rumor was, that Caesar, a better politician than his father, had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals. I say the two, because Cardinal Rospigliosi, who had not taken any precaution, was completely despoiled.

""Up to this point,"" said Faria, interrupting the thread of his narrative, ""this seems to you very meaningless, no doubt, eh?""
""Oh, my friend,"" cried Dantes, ""on the contrary, it seems as if I were reading a most interesting narrative; go on, I beg of you.""

""I will.""

""The family began to get accustomed to their obscurity. Years rolled on, and amongst the descendants some were soldiers, others diplomatists; some churchmen, some bankers; some grew rich, and some were ruined. I come now to the last of the family, whose secretary I was—the Count of Spada. I had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank with his fortune; and I advised him to invest all he had in an annuity. He did so, and thus doubled his income. The celebrated breviary remained in the family, and was in the count's possession. It had been handed down from father to son; for the singular clause of the only will that had been found, had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic, preserved in the family with superstitious veneration. It was an illuminated book, with beautiful Gothic characters, and so weighty with gold, that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity.

""At the sight of papers of all sorts,—titles, contracts, parchments, which were kept in the archives of the family, all descending from the poisoned cardinal, I in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents, like twenty servitors, stewards, secretaries before me; but in spite of the most exhaustive researches, I found—nothing. Yet I had read, I had even written a precise history of the Borgia family, for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the Cardinal Caesar Spada; but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the Cardinal Rospigliosi, his companion in misfortune.

""I was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the Borgias nor the family, but had remained unpossessed like the treasures of the Arabian Nights, which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the genie. I searched, ransacked, counted, calculated a thousand and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for three hundred years. It was useless. I remained in my ignorance, and the Count of Spada in his poverty. My patron died. He had reserved from his annuity his family papers, his library, composed of five thousand volumes, and his famous breviary. All these he bequeathed to me, with a thousand Roman crowns, which he had in ready money, on condition that I would have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul, and that I would draw up a genealogical tree and history of his house. All this I did scrupulously. Be easy, my dear Edmond, we are near the conclusion.

""In 1807, a month before I was arrested, and a fortnight after the death of the Count of Spada, on the 25th of December (you will see presently how the date became fixed in my memory), I was reading, for the thousandth time, the papers I was arranging, for the palace was sold to a stranger, and I was going to leave Rome and settle at Florence, intending to take with me twelve thousand francs I possessed, my library, and the famous breviary, when, tired with my constant labor at the same thing, and overcome by a heavy dinner I had eaten, my head dropped on my hands, and I fell asleep about three o'clock in the afternoon. I awoke as the clock was striking six. I raised my head; I was in utter darkness. I rang for a light, but as no one came, I determined to find one for myself. It was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which I should soon be under the necessity of adopting. I took a wax-candle in one hand, and with the other groped about for a piece of paper (my match-box being empty), with which I proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the embers. Fearing, however, to make use of any valuable piece of paper, I hesitated for a moment, then recollected that I had seen in the famous breviary, which was on the table beside me, an old paper quite yellow with age, and which had served as a marker for centuries, kept there by the request of the heirs. I felt for it, found it, twisted it up together, and putting it into the expiring flame, set light to it.

""But beneath my fingers, as if by magic, in proportion as the fire ascended, I saw yellowish characters appear on the paper. I grasped it in my hand, put out the flame as quickly as I could, lighted my taper in the fire itself, and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion, recognizing, when I had done so, that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink, only appearing when exposed to the fire; nearly one-third of the paper had been consumed by the flame. It was that paper you read this morning; read it again, Dantes, and then I will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense.""

Faria, with an air of triumph, offered the paper to Dantes, who this time read the following words, traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust:—

        ""This 25th day of April, 1498, be...
        Alexander VI., and fearing that not...
        he may desire to become my heir, and re...

        ""25th April, 1498.
        ""Caes...
""And now,"" said the abbe, ""read this other paper;"" and he presented to Dantes a second leaf with fragments of lines written on it, which Edmond read as follows:—

""...ing invited to dine by his Holiness
            ...content with making me pay for my hat,
        ...serves for me the fate of Cardinals Caprara
                ...I declare to my nephew, Guido Spada
                    ...ried in a place he knows
                        ...the caves of the small

                    ...ings have been made
                    ...ngle in the second;
                    ...tire to him
                            ...ar Spada.""
Faria followed him with an excited look, ""and now,"" he said, when he saw that Dantes had read the last line, ""put the two fragments together, and judge for yourself."" Dantes obeyed, and the conjointed pieces gave the following:—

""This 25th day of April, 1498, be...ing invited to dine by his Holiness Alexander VI., and fearing that not...content with making me pay for my hat, he may desire to become my heir, and re...serves for me the fate of Cardinals Caprara and Bentivoglio, who were poisoned...I declare to my nephew, Guido Spada, my sole heir, that I have bu...ried in a place he knows and has visited with me, that is, in...the caves of the small Island of Monte Cristo all I poss...ssed of ingots, gold, money, jewels, diamonds, gems; that I alone...know of the existence of this treasure, which may amount to nearly two mil...lions of Roman crowns, and which he will find on raising the twentieth ro...ck from the small creek to the east in a right line.

""Caes...ar Spada.""

""Well, do you comprehend now?"" inquired Faria.

""It is the declaration of Cardinal Spada, and the will so long sought for,"" replied Edmond, still incredulous.
""Yes; a thousand times, yes!""

""And who completed it as it now is?""

""I did. Aided by the remaining fragment, I guessed the rest; measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper, and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed, as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above us.""

""And what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion?""

""I resolved to set out, and did set out at that very instant, carrying with me the beginning of my great work, the unity of the Italian kingdom; but for some time the imperial police (who at this period, quite contrary to what Napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him, wished for a partition of provinces) had their eyes on me; and my hasty departure, the cause of which they were unable to guess, having aroused their suspicions, I was arrested at the very moment I was leaving Piombino.

""Now,"" continued Faria, addressing Dantes with an almost paternal expression, ""now, my dear fellow, you know as much as I do myself. If we ever escape together, half this treasure is yours; if I die here, and you escape alone, the whole belongs to you.""

""But,"" inquired Dantes hesitating, ""has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves?""

""No, no, be easy on that score; the family is extinct. The last Count of Spada, moreover, made me his heir, bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary, he bequeathed to me all it contained; no, no, make your mind satisfied on that point. If we lay hands on this fortune, we may enjoy it without remorse.""

""And you say this treasure amounts to""—

""Two millions of Roman crowns; nearly thirteen millions of our money."" [*]

                * $2,600,000 in 1894.
""Impossible!"" said Dantes, staggered at the enormous amount.

""Impossible? and why?"" asked the old man. ""The Spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in those times, when other opportunities for investment were wanting, such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at this day Roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and which they cannot touch."" Edmond thought he was in a dream—he wavered between incredulity and joy.

""I have only kept this secret so long from you,"" continued Faria, ""that I might test your character, and then surprise you. Had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy, I should have conducted you to Monte Cristo; now,"" he added, with a sigh, ""it is you who will conduct me thither. Well, Dantes, you do not thank me?""

""This treasure belongs to you, my dear friend,"" replied Dantes, ""and to you only. I have no right to it. I am no relation of yours.""

""You are my son, Dantes,"" exclaimed the old man. ""You are the child of my captivity. My profession condemns me to celibacy. God has sent you to me to console, at one and the same time, the man who could not be a father, and the prisoner who could not get free."" And Faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man who threw himself upon his neck and wept.",176993,en,en,en

Sunset Speech from Faust,misc,Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,2016,5,"{""Translated by A. Z. Foreman""}","Behold how by the evening’s solar fire
The cabins are aglow in greenery.
The day is lived and done; the reeling sun
Hurries away to foster life elsewhere,
And I want wings to take me up out there
To strive and follow on!
I'd see the silent world unfold
Before my feet in endless evening rays,
The quiet of the dells, the hills ablaze,
The silver brooks that run to streams of gold.
My course would be a god’s, unhindered by
The savage mountain and its craggy face;
Already now the sea with sun-warmed bays
Lies open to the dazzled eye.
And now that solar goddess falls from sight;
But a new urge impels the mind:
I'm off to drink her everlasting light,
With day before me and the night behind,
The waves below and, overhead, the sky.
It is a gorgeous dream. The sun must flee.
Alas! These spirit wings will never be
Conjoined corporeal wings on which to fly!
Yet it is utterly innate
For feeling to want out, to soar anew
When aimless skylarks jubilate
Above us in the spacious blue,
When over craggy, pine-clad highlands
The opened wings of eagles roam,
And, over meadowlands and islands,
The striving crane goes gliding home.",2804058,en,en,en

Malcolm X,misc,Sarah Skar,2016,34,{},"Malcolm X’s life changed dramatically in the first six months of 1964.  On March 8, he left the Nation of Islam.  In May he toured West Africa and made a pilgrimage to Mecca, returning as El Hajj Malik El-Shabazz.  While in Ghana in May, he decided to form the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU).  Malcolm returned to New York the following month to create the OAAU and on June 28 gave his first public address on behalf of the new organization at the Audubon Ballroom in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan.  That address appears below.

Salaam Alaikum, Mr. Moderator, our distinguished guests, brothers and sisters, our friends and our enemies, everybody who's here.

As many of you know, last March when it was announced that I was no longer in the Black Muslim movement, it was pointed out that it was my intention to work among the 22 million non-Muslim Afro-Americans and to try and form some type of organization, or create a situation where the young people – our young people, the students and others – could study the problems of our people for a period of time and then come up with a new analysis and give us some new ideas and some new suggestions as to how to approach a problem that too many other people have been playing around with for too long. And that we would have some kind of meeting and determine at a later date whether to form a black nationalist party or a black nationalist army.

There have been many of our people across the country from all walks of life who have taken it upon themselves to try and pool their ideas and to come up with some kind of solution to the problem that confronts all of our people. And tonight we are here to try and get an understanding of what it is they've come up with.

Also, recently when I was blessed to make a religious pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca where I met many people from all over the world, plus spent many weeks in Africa trying to broaden my own scope and get more of an open mind to look at the problem as it actually is, one of the things that I realized, and I realized this even before going over there, was that our African brothers have gained their independence faster than you and I here in America have. They've also gained recognition and respect as human beings much faster than you and I.
Just ten years ago on the African continent, our people were colonized. They were suffering all forms of colonization, oppression, exploitation, degradation, humiliation, discrimination, and every other kind of -ation. And in a short time, they have gained more independence, more recognition, more respect as human beings than you and I have. And you and I live in a country which is supposed to be the citadel of education, freedom, justice, democracy, and all of those other pretty-sounding words.

So it was our intention to try and find out what it was our African brothers were doing to get results, so that you and I could study what they had done and perhaps gain from that study or benefit from their experiences. And my traveling over there was designed to help to find out how.

One of the first things that the independent African nations did was to form an organization called the Organization of African Unity. This organization consists of all independent African states who have reached the agreement to submerge all differences and combine their efforts toward eliminating from the continent of Africa colonialism and all vestiges of oppression and exploitation being suffered by African people. Those who formed the organization of African states have differences. They represent probably every segment, every type of thinking. You have some leaders that are considered Uncle Toms, some leaders who are considered very militant. But even the militant African leaders were able to sit down at the same table with African leaders whom they considered to be Toms, or Tshombes, or that type of character. They forgot their differences for the sole purpose of bringing benefits to the whole. And whenever you find people who can't forget their differences, then they're more interested in their personal aims and objectives than they are in the conditions of the whole. Well, the African leaders showed their maturity by doing what the American white man said couldn't be done. Because if you recall when it was mentioned that these African states were going to meet in Addis Ababa, all of the Western press began to spread the propaganda that they didn't have enough in common to come together and to sit down together. Why, they had Nkrumah there, one of the most militant of the African leaders, and they had Adoula from the Congo. They had Nyerere there, they had Ben Bella there, they had Nasser there, they had Sekou Toure, they had Obote; they had Kenyatta  I guess Kenyatta was there, I can't remember whether Kenya was independent at that time, but I think he was there. Everyone was there and despite their differences, they were able to sit down and form what was known as the Organization of African Unity, which has formed a coalition and is working in conjunction with each other to fight a common enemy. Once we saw what they were able to do, we determined to try and do the same thing here in America among Afro Americans who have been divided by our enemies. So we have formed an organization known as the Organization of Afro American Unity which has the same aim and objective – to fight whoever gets in our way, to bring about the complete independence of people of African descent here in the Western Hemisphere, and first here in the United States, and bring about the freedom of these people by any means necessary.

That's our motto. We want freedom by any means necessary. We want justice by any means necessary. We want equality by any means necessary. We don't feel that in 1964, living in a country that is supposedly based upon freedom, and supposedly the leader of the free world, we don't think that we should have to sit around and wait for some segregationist congressmen and senators and a President from Texas in Washington, D. C., to make up their minds that our people are due now some degree of civil rights. No, we want it now or we don't think anybody should have it.

The purpose of our organization is to start right here in Harlem, which has the largest concentration of people of African descent that exists anywhere on this earth. There are more Africans in Harlem than exist in any city on the African continent. Because that's what you and I are Africans. You catch any white man off guard in here right now, you catch him off guard and ask him what he is, he doesn't say he's an American. He either tells you he's Irish, or he's Italian, or he's German, if you catch him off guard and he doesn't know what you're up to. And even though he was born here, he'll tell you he's Italian. Well, if he's Italian, you and I are African even though we were born here.
So we start in New York City first. We start in Harlem– and by Harlem we mean Bedford – Stuyvesant, any place in this area where you and I live, that's Harlem with the intention of spreading throughout the state, and from the state throughout the country, and from the country throughout the Western Hemisphere. Because when we say Afro American, we include everyone in the Western Hemisphere of African descent. South America is America. Central America is America. South America has many people in it of African descent. And everyone in South America of African descent is an Afro-American. Everyone in the Caribbean, whether it's the West Indies or Cuba or Mexico, if they have African blood, they are Afro Americans. If they're in Canada and they have African blood, they're Afro Americans. If they're in Alaska, though they might call themselves Eskimos, if they have African blood, they're Afro Americans.

So the purpose of the Organization of Afro American Unity is to unite everyone in the Western Hemisphere of African descent into one united force. And then, once we are united among ourselves in the Western Hemisphere, we will unite with our brothers on the motherland, on the continent of Africa. So to get right with it, I would like to read you the ""Basic Aims and Objectives of the Organization of Afro American Unity;"" started here in New York, June, 1964.
""The Organization of Afro American Unity, organized and structured by a cross section of the Afro American people living in the United States of America, has been patterned after the letter and spirit of the Organization of African Unity which was established at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in May of 1963.

""We, the members of the Organization of Afro American Unity, gathered together in Harlem, New York:

""Convinced that it is the inalienable right of all our people to control our own destiny;

""Conscious of the fact that freedom, equality, justice and dignity are central objectives for the achievement of the legitimate aspirations of the people of African descent here in the Western Hemisphere, we will endeavor to build a bridge of understanding and create the basis for Afro American unity;

""Conscious of our responsibility to harness the natural and human resources of our people for their total advancement in all spheres of human endeavor;

""Inspired by our common determination to promote understanding among our people and cooperation in all matters pertaining to their survival and advancement, we will support the aspirations of our people for brotherhood and solidarity in a larger unity transcending all organizational differences;

“Convinced that, in order to translate this determination into a dynamic force in the cause of human progress conditions of peace and security must be established and maintained;"" – And by ""conditions of peace and security,"" [we mean] we have to eliminate the barking of the police dogs, we have to eliminate the police clubs, we have to eliminate the water hoses, we have to eliminate all of these things that have become so characteristic of the American so called dream. These have to be eliminated. Then we will be living in a condition of peace and security. We can never have peace and security as long as one black man in this country is being bitten by a police dog. No one in the country has peace and security.  ""Dedicated to the unification of all people of African descent in this hemisphere and to the utilization of that unity to bring into being the organizational structure that will project the black people's contributions to the world;

""Persuaded that the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights are the principles in which we believe and that these documents if put into practice represent the essence of mankind's hopes and good intentions;

""Desirous that all Afro American people and organi¬zations should henceforth unite so that the welfare and well being of our people will be assured;

""We are resolved to reinforce the common bond of purpose between our people by submerging all of our differences and establishing a nonsectarian, constructive program for human rights;

""We hereby present this charter.

""I–Establishment.

""The Organization of Afro American Unity shall include all people of African descent in the Western Hemisphere, as well as our brothers and sisters on the African continent."" Which means anyone of African descent, with African blood, can become a member of the Organization of Afro American Unity, and also any one of our brothers and sisters from the African continent. Because not only it is an organization of Afro American unity meaning that we are trying to unite our people in the West, but it's an organization of Afro American unity in the sense that we want to unite all of our people who are in North America, South America, and Central America with our people on the African continent. We must unite together in order to go forward together. Africa will not go forward any faster than we will and we will not go forward any faster than Africa will. We have one destiny and we've had one past.
In essence, what it is saying is instead of you and me running around here seeking allies in our struggle for freedom in the Irish neighborhood or the Jewish neighborhood or the Italian neighborhood, we need to seek some allies among people who look something like we do. It's time now for you and me to stop running away from the wolf right into the arms of the fox, looking for some kind of help. That's a drag.

""II–Self Defense.

""Since self preservation is the first law of nature, we assert the Afro American's right to self defense.

""The Constitution of the United States of America clearly affirms the right of every American citizen to bear arms. And as Americans, we will not give up a single right guaranteed under the Constitution. The history of unpunished violence against our people clearly indicates that we must be prepared to defend ourselves or we will continue to be a defenseless people at the mercy of a ruthless and violent racist mob.

""We assert that in those areas where the government is either unable or unwilling to protect the lives and property of our people, that our people are within our rights to protect themselves by whatever means necessary.”I repeat, because to me this is the most important thing you need to know. I already know it. ""We assert that in those areas where the government is either unable or unwilling to protect the lives and property of our people, that our people are within our rights to protect themselves by whatever means necessary.""

This is the thing you need to spread the word about among our people wherever you go. Never let them be brainwashed into thinking that whenever they take steps to see that they're in a position to defend themselves that they're being unlawful. The only time you're being unlawful is when you break the law. It's lawful to have something to defend yourself. Why, I heard President Johnson either today or yesterday, I guess it was today, talking about how quick this country would go to war to defend itself. Why, what kind of a fool do you look like, living in a country that will go to war at the drop of a hat to defend itself, and here you've got to stand up in the face of vicious police dogs and blue eyed crackers waiting for somebody to tell you what to do to defend yourself!

Those days are over, they're gone, that's yesterday. The time for you and me to allow ourselves to be brutalized nonviolently is passé. Be nonviolent only with those who are nonviolent to you. And when you can bring me a nonviolent racist, bring me a nonviolent segregationist, then I'll get nonviolent. But don't teach me to be nonviolent until you teach some of those crackers to be nonviolent. You've never seen a nonviolent cracker. It's hard for a racist to be nonviolent. It's hard for anyone intelligent to be nonviolent. Everything in the universe does something when you start playing with his life, except the American Negro. He lays down and says, "" Beat me, daddy."" So it says here: ""A man with a rifle or a club can only be stopped by a person who defends himself with a rifle or a club."" That's equality. If you have a dog, I must have a dog. If you have a rifle, I must have a rifle. If you have a club, I must have a club. This is equality. If the United States government doesn't want you and me to get rifles, then take the rifles away from those racists. If they don't want you and me to use clubs, take the clubs away from the racists. If they don't want you and me to get violent, then stop the racists from being violent. Don't teach us nonviolence while those crackers are violent. Those days are over.

""Tactics based solely on morality can only succeed when you are dealing with people who are moral or a system that is moral. A man or system which oppresses a man because of his color is not moral. It is the duty of every Afro-American person and every Afro-American community throughout this country to protect its people against mass murderers, against bombers, against lynchers, against floggers, against brutalizers and against exploiters.

""I might say right here that instead of the various black groups declaring war on each other, showing how militant they can be cracking each other's heads, let them go down South and crack some of those crackers' heads. Any group of people in this country that has a record of having been attacked by racists – and there's no record where they have ever given the signal to take the heads of some of those racists – why, they are insane giving the signal to take the heads of some of their ex-brothers. Or brother X's, I don't know how you put that.

III– Education

""Education is an important element in the struggle for human rights. It is the means to help our children and our people rediscover their identity and thereby increase their self respect. Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs only to the people who prepare for it today.""

And I must point out right there, when I was in Africa I met no African who wasn't standing with open arms to embrace any Afro-American who returned to the African continent. But one of the things that all of them have said is that every one of our people in this country should take advantage of every type of educational opportunity available before you even think about talking about the future. If you're surrounded by schools, go to that school.

""Our children are being criminally shortchanged in the public school system of America. The Afro-American schools are the poorest run schools in the city of New York. Principals and teachers fail to understand the nature of the problems with which they work and as a result they cannot do the job of teaching our children."" They don't understand us, nor do they understand our problems; they don't. ""The textbooks tell our children nothing about the great contributions of Afro-Americans to the growth and development of this country.""
And they don't. When we send our children to school in this country they learn nothing about us other than that we used to be cotton pickers. Every little child going to school thinks his grandfather was a cotton picker. Why, your grandfather was Nat Turner; your grandfather was Toussaint L'Ouverture; your grandfather was Hannibal. Your grandfather was some of the greatest black people who walked on this earth. It was your grandfather's hands who forged civilization and it was your grandmother's hands who rocked the cradle of civilization. But the textbooks tell our children nothing about the great contributions of Afro Americans to the growth and development of this country.

""The Board of Education's integration plan is expensive and unworkable; and the organization of principals and supervisors in New York City's school system has refused to support the Board's plan to integrate the schools, thus dooming it to failure before it even starts.”The Board of Education of this city has said that even with its plan there are 10 percent of the schools in Harlem and the Bedford Stuyvesant community in Brooklyn that they cannot improve."" So what are we to do? ""This means that the Organization of Afro American Unity must make the Afro American community a more potent force for educational self improvement.

""A first step in the program to end the existing system of racist education is to demand that the 10 percent of the schools the Board of Education will not include in its plan be turned over to and run by the Afro-American community itself."" Since they say that they can't improve these schools, why should you and I who live in the community, let these fools continue to run and produce this low standard of education? No, let them turn those schools over to us. Since they say they can't handle them, nor can they correct them, let us take a whack at it.
What do we want? ""We want Afro-American principals to head these schools. We want Afro-American teachers in these schools."" Meaning we want black principals and black teachers with some textbooks about black people. "" We want textbooks written by Afro-Americans that are acceptable to our people before they can be used in these schools.

""The Organization of Afro-American Unity will select and recommend people to serve on local school boards where school policy is made and passed on to the Board of Education."" And this is very important.

""Through these steps we will make the 10 percent of the schools that we take over educational showplaces that will attract the attention of people from ail over the nation."" Instead of them being schools turning out pupils whose academic diet is not complete, we can turn them into examples of what we can do ourselves once given an opportunity.

""If these proposals are not met, we will ask Afro-American parents to keep their children out of the present inferior schools they attend. And when these schools in our neighborhood are controlled by Afro Americans, we will then return our children to them.

""The Organization of Afro American Unity recognizes the tremendous importance of the complete involvement of Afro-American parents in every phase of school life. The Afro American parent must be willing and able to go into the schools and see that the job of educating our children is done properly."" This whole thing about putting all of the blame on the teacher is out the window. The parent at home has just as much responsibility to see that what's going on in that school is up to par as the teacher in their schools. So it is our intention not only to devise an education program for the children, but one also for the parents to make them aware of their responsibility where education is concerned in regard to their children.

""We call on all Afro-Americans around the nation to be aware that the conditions that exist in the New York City public school system are as deplorable in their does as they are here. We must unite our efforts and spread our program of self improvement through education to every Afro American community in America.

""We must establish all over the country schools of our own to train our own children to become scientists, to become mathematicians. We must realize the need for adult education and for job retraining programs that will emphasize a changing society in which automation plays the key role. We intend to use the tools of education to help raise our people to an unprecedented level of excellence and self respect through their own efforts.

""IV – Politics and Economics.""

And the two are almost inseparable, because the politician is depending on some money; yes, that's what he's depending on.

""Basically, there are two kinds of power that count in America: economic power and political power, with social power being derived from those two. In order for the Afro-Americans to control their destiny, they must be able to control and affect the decisions which control their destiny: economic, political, and social. This can only be done through organization.

""The Organization of Afro-American Unity will organize the Afro American community block by block to make the community aware of its power and its potential; we will start immediately a voter registration drive to make every unregistered voter in the Afro-American community an independent voter.""

We won't organize any black man to be a Democrat or a Republican because both of them have sold us out. Both of them have sold us out; both parties have sold us out. Both parties are racist, and the Democratic Party is more racist than the Republican Party. I can prove it. All you've got to do is name everybody who's running the government in Washington, D. C., right now. He's a Democrat and he's from either Georgia, Alabama, Texas, Mississippi, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, from one of those cracker states. And they've got more power than any white man in the North has. In fact, the President is from a cracker state. What's he talking about? Texas is a cracker state, in fact, they'll hang you quicker in Texas than they will in Mississippi. Don't you ever think that just because a cracker becomes president he ceases being a cracker. He was a cracker before he became president and he's a cracker while he's president. I'm going to tell it like it is. I hope you can take it like it is.

""We propose to support and organize political clubs, to run independent candidates for office, and to support any Afro-American already in office who answers to and is responsible to the Afro-American community."" We don't support any black man who is controlled by the white power structure. We will start not only a voter registration drive, but a voter education drive to let our people have an understanding of the science of politics so they will be able to see what part the politician plays in the scheme of things; so they will be able to understand when the politician is doing his job and when he is not doing his job. And any time the politician is not doing his job, we remove him whether he's white, black, green, blue, yellow or whatever other color they might invent.

""The economic exploitation in the Afro-American community is the most vicious form practiced on any people in America."" In fact, it is the most vicious practiced on any people on this earth. No one is exploited economically as thoroughly as you and I, because in most countries where people are exploited they know it. You and I are in this country being exploited and sometimes we don't know it. ""Twice as much rent is paid for rat-infested, roach crawling, rotting tenements.""

This is true. It costs us more to live in Harlem than it costs them to live on Park Avenue. Do you know that the rent is higher on Park Avenue in Harlem than it is on Park Avenue downtown? And in Harlem you have everything else in that apartment with you roaches, rats, cats, dogs, and some other outsiders disguised as landlords. ""The Afro-American pays more for food, pays more for clothing, pays more for insurance than anybody else."" And we do. It costs you and me more for insurance than it does the white man in the Bronx or somewhere else. It costs you and me more for food than it does them. It costs you and me more to live in America than it does anybody else and yet we make the greatest contribution.

You tell me what kind of country this is. Why should we do the dirtiest jobs for the lowest pay? Why should we do the hardest work for the lowest pay? Why should we pay the most money for the worst kind of food and the most money for the worst kind of place to live in? I'm telling you we do it because we live in one of the rottenest countries that has ever existed on this earth. It's the system that is rotten; we have a rotten system. It's a system of exploitation, a political and economic system of exploitation, of outright humiliation, degradation, discrimination – all of the negative things that you can run into, you have run into under this system that disguises itself as a democracy, disguises itself as a democracy. And the things that they practice against you and me are worse than some of the things that they practiced in Germany against the Jews. Worse than some of the things that the Jews ran into. And you run around here getting ready to get drafted and go someplace and defend it. Someone needs to crack you up 'side your head.

""The Organization of Afro American Unity will wage an unrelenting struggle against these evils in our community. There shall be organizers to work with our people to solve these problems, and start a housing self-improvement program."" Instead of waiting for the white man to come and straighten out our neighborhood, we'll straighten it out ourselves. This is where you make your mistake. An outsider can't clean up your house as well as you can. An outsider can't take care of your children as well as you can. An outsider can't look after your needs as well as you can. And an outsider can't under¬stand your problems as well as you can. Yet you're looking for an outsider to do it. We will do it or it will never get done.

""We propose to support rent strikes."" Yes, not little, small rent strikes in one block. We'll make Harlem a rent strike. We'll get every black man in this city; the Organization of Afro-American Unity won't stop until there's not a black man in the city not on strike. Nobody will pay any rent. The whole city will come to a halt. And they can't put all of us in jail because they've already got the jails full of us.

Concerning our social needs  I hope I'm not frightening anyone. I should stop right here and tell you if you're the type of person who frights, who gets scared, you should never come around us. Because we'll scare you to death. And. you don't have far to go because you're half dead already. Economically you're dead- dead broke. Just got paid yesterday and dead broke right now.

""V  Social.

""This organization is responsible only to the Afro-American people and the Afro-American community."" This organization is not responsible to anybody but us. We don't have to ask the man downtown can we demonstrate. We don't have to ask the man downtown what tactics we can use to demonstrate our resentment against his criminal abuse. We don't have to ask his consent; we don't have to ask his endorsement; we don't have to ask his permission. Anytime we know that an unjust condition exists and it is illegal and unjust, we will strike at it by any means necessary. And strike also at whatever and whoever gets in the way.

""This organization is responsible only to the Afro-American people and community and will function only with their support, both financially and numerically. We believe that our communities must be the sources of their own strength politically, economically, intellectually, and culturally in the struggle for human rights and human dignity.

""The community must reinforce its moral responsibility to rid itself of the effects of years of exploitation, neglect, and apathy, and wage an unrelenting struggle against police brutality."" Yes. There are some good policemen and some bad policemen. Usually we get the bad ones. With all the police in Harlem, there is too much crime, too much drug addiction, too much alcoholism, too much prostitution, too much gambling.
So it makes us suspicious about the motives of Commissioner Murphy when he sends all these policemen up here. We begin to think that they are just his errand boys, whose job it is to pick up the graft and take it back downtown to Murphy. Anytime there's a police commissioner who finds it necessary to increase the strength numerically of the policemen in Harlem and, at the same time, we don't see any sign of a decrease in crime, why, I think we're justified in suspecting his mo¬tives. He can't be sending them up here to fight crime, because crime is on the increase. The more cops we have, the more crime we have. We begin to think that they bring some of the crime with them.

So our purpose is to organize the community so that we ourselves since the police can't eliminate the drug traffic, we have to eliminate it. Since the police can't eliminate organized gambling, we have to eliminate it. Since the police can't eliminate organized prostitution and all of these evils that are destroying the moral fiber of our community, it is up to you and me to eliminate these evils ourselves. But in many instances, when you unite in this country or in this city to fight organized crime, you'll find yourselves fighting the police department itself because they are involved in the organized crime. Wherever you have organized crime, that type of crime cannot exist other than with the consent of the police, the knowledge of the police and the cooperation of the police.

You'll agree that you can't run a number in your neighborhood without the police knowing it. A prostitute can't turn a trick on the block without the police knowing it. A man can't push drugs anywhere along the avenue without the police knowing it. And they pay the police off so that they will not get arrested. I know what I'm talking about  I used to be out there. And I know you can't hustle out there without police setting you up. You have to pay them off.

The police are all right. I say there's some good ones and some bad ones. But they usually send the bad ones to Harlem. Since these bad police have come to Harlem and have not decreased the high rate of crime, I tell you brothers and sisters it is time for you and me to organize and eliminate these evils ourselves, or we'll be out of the world backwards before we even know where the world was.

Drug addiction turns your little sister into a prostitute before she gets into her teens; makes a criminal out of your little brother before he gets in his teens drug addiction and alcoholism. And if you and I aren't men enough to get at the root of these things, then we don't even have the right to walk around here complaining about it in any form whatsoever. The police will not eliminate it. ""Our community must reinforce its moral responsibility to rid itself of the effects of years of exploitation, neglect, and apathy, and wage an unrelenting struggle against police brutality.""

Where this police brutality also comes in the new law that they just passed, the no knock law, the stop and-frisk law, that's an anti Negro law. That's a law that was passed and signed by Rockefeller. Rockefeller with his old smile, always he has a greasy smile on his face and he's shaking hands with Negroes, like he's the Negro's pappy or granddaddy or great uncle. Yet when it comes to passing a law that is worse than any law that they had in Nazi Germany, why, Rockefeller couldn't wait till he got his signature on it. And the only thing this law is designed to do is make legal what they've been doing all the time.

They've passed a law that gives them the right to knock down your door without even knocking on it. Knock it down and come on in and bust your head and frame you up under the disguise that they suspect you of something. Why, brothers, they didn't have laws that bad in Nazi Germany. And it was passed for you and me, it's an anti Negro law, because you've got an anti-Negro governor sitting up there in Albany – I started to say Albany, Georgia – in Albany, New York. Not too much difference. Not too much difference between Albany, New York, and Albany, Georgia. And there's not too much difference between the government that's in Albany, New York, and the government in Albany, Georgia.

""The Afro-American community must accept the responsibility for regaining our people who have lost their place in society. We must declare an all out war on organized crime in our community; a vice that is controlled by policemen who accept bribes and graft must be exposed. We must establish a clinic, whereby one can get aid and cure for drug addiction.""

This is absolutely necessary. When a person is a drug addict, he's not the criminal; he's a victim of the criminal. The criminal is the man downtown who brings drug into the country. Negroes can't bring drugs into this country. You don't have any boats. You don't have any airplanes. You don't have any diplomatic immunity. It is not you who is responsible for bringing in drugs. You're just a little tool that is used by the man downtown. The man that controls the drug traffic sits in city hall or he sits in the state house. Big shots who are respected, who function in high circles those are the ones who control these things. And you and I will never strike at the root of it until we strike at the man downtown.

""We must create meaningful, creative, useful activities for those who were led astray down the avenues of vice.”The people of the Afro- American community must be prepared to help each other in all ways possible; we must establish a place where unwed mothers can get help and advice."" This is a problem, this is one of the worst problems in our. . . [A short passage is lost here as the tape is turned.]

""We must set up a guardian system that will help our youth who get into trouble."" Too many of our children get into trouble accidentally. And once they get into trouble, because they have no one to look out for them, they're put in some of these homes where others who are experienced at getting in trouble are. And immediately it's a bad influence on them and they never have a chance to straighten out their lives. Too many of our children have their entire lives destroyed in this manner. It is up to you and me right now to form the type of organizations wherein we can look out for the needs of all of these young people who get into trouble, especially those who get into trouble for the first time, so that we can do something to steer them back on the right path before they go too far astray.

""And we must provide constructive activities for our own children. We must set a good example for our children and must teach them to always be ready to accept the responsibilities that are necessary for building good communities and nations. We must teach them that their greatest responsibilities are to themselves, to their families and to their communities.

""The Organization of Afro-American Unity believes that the Afro American community must endeavor to do the major part of all charity work from within the community. Charity, however, does not mean that to which we are legally entitled in the form of government benefits. The Afro-American veteran must be made aware of all the benefits due to him and the procedure for obtaining them.""

Many of our people have sacrificed their lives on the battlefront for this country. There are many government benefits that our people don't even know about. Many of them are qualified to receive aid in all forms, but they don't even know it. But we know this, so it is our duty, those of us who know it, to set up a system where¬ in our people who are not informed of what is coming to them, we inform them, we let them know how they can lay claim to everything that they've got coming to them from this government. And I mean you've got much coming to you. ""The veterans must be encouraged to go into business together, using GI loans,"" and all other items that we have access to or have available to us.

""Afro Americans must unite and work together. We must take pride in the Afro American community, for it is our home and it is our power,"" the base of our power.

""What we do here in regaining our self respect, our manhood, our dignity and freedom helps all people everywhere who are also fighting against oppression."" Lastly, concerning culture and the cultural aspect of the Organization of Afro American Unity.

"" 'A race of people is like an individual man; until it uses its own talent, takes pride in its own history, expresses its own culture, affirms its own selfhood, it can never fulfill itself.' ""

""Our history and our culture were completely destroyed when we were forcibly brought to America in chains. And now it is important for us to know that our history did not begin with slavery. We came from Africa, a great continent, wherein live a proud and varied people, a land which is the new world and was the cradle of civilization. Our culture and our history are as old as man himself and yet we know almost nothing about it.""

This is no accident. It is no accident that such a high state of culture existed in Africa and you and I know nothing about it. Why, the man knew that as long as you and I thought we were somebody, he could never treat us like we were nobody. So he had to invent a system that would strip us of everything about us that we could use to prove we were somebody. And once he had stripped us of all human chacteristics stripped us of our language, stripped us of our history, stripped us of all cultural knowledge, and brought us down to the level of an animal – he then began to treat us like an animal, selling us from one plantation to another, selling us from one owner to another, breeding us like you breed cattle.

Why, brothers and sisters, when you wake up and find out what this man here has done to you and me, you won't even wait for somebody to give the word. I'm not saying all of them are bad. There might be some good ones. But we don't have time to look for them. Not nowadays.
""We must recapture our heritage and our identity if we are ever to liberate ourselves from the bonds of white supremacy. We must launch a cultural revolution to unbrainwash an entire people."" A cultural revolution. Why, brothers, that's a crazy revolution. When you tell this black man in America who he is, where he came from, what he had when he was there, he'll look around and ask himself, ""Well, what happened to it, who took it away from us and how did they do it?"" Why, brothers, you'll have some action just like that. When you let the black man in America know where he once was and what he once had, why, he only needs to look at himself now to realize something criminal was done to him to bring him down to the low condition that he's in today.

Once he realizes what was done, how it was done, where it was done, when it was done, and who did it, that knowledge in itself will usher in your action program. And it will be by any means necessary. A man doesn't know how to act until he realizes what he's acting against. And you don't realize what you're acting against until you realize what they did to you. Too many of you don't know what they did to you, and this is what makes you so quick to want to forget and forgive. No, brothers, when you see what has happened to you, you will never forget and you'll never forgive. And, as I say, all of them might not be guilty. But most of them are. Most of them are.

""Our cultural revolution must be the means of bringing us closer to our African brothers and sisters. It must begin in the community and be based on community participation. Afro-Americans will be free to create only when they can depend on the Afro-American community for support, and Afro-American artists must realize that they depend on the Afro-American community for inspiration.""

Our artists we have artists who are geniuses; they don't have to act the Stepin Fetchit role. But as long as they're looking for white support instead of black support, they've got to act like the old white supporter wants them to. When you and I begin to support the black artists, then the black artists can play that black role. As long as the black artist has to sing and dance to please the white man, he'll be a clown, he'll be clowning, just another clown. But when he can sing and dance to please black men, he sings a different song and he dances a different step. When we get together, we've got a step all our own. We have a step that nobody can do but us, because we have a reason for doing it that nobody can understand but us.

""We must work toward the establishment of a cultural center in Harlem, which will include people of all ages and will conduct workshops in all of the arts, such as film, creative writing, painting, theater, music, and the entire spectrum of Afro American history.

""This cultural revolution will be the journey to our rediscovery of ourselves. History is a people's memory, and without a memory man is demoted to the level of the lower animals."" When you have no knowledge of your history, you're just another animal; in fact, you're a Negro; something that's nothing. The only black man on earth who is called a Negro is one who has no knowl¬edge of his history. The only black man on earth who is called a Negro is one who doesn't know where he came from. That's the one in America. They don't call Africans Negroes.
Why, I had a white man tell me the other day, ""He's not a Negro."" Here the man was black as night, and the white man told me, “He’s not a Negro, he's an African."" I said, ""Well, listen to him."" I knew he wasn't, but I wanted to pull old whitey out, you know. But it shows you that they know this. You are Negro because you don't know who you are, you don't know what you are, you don't know where you are, and you don't know how you got here. But as soon as you wake up and find out the positive answer to all these things, you cease being a Negro. You become somebody.

""Armed with the knowledge of our past, we can with confidence charter a course for our future. Culture is an indispensable weapon in the freedom struggle. We must take hold of it and forge the future with the past."" And to quote a passage from Then We Heard the Thunder by John Killens, it says: ""He was a dedicated patriot: Dignity was his country, Manhood was his gov¬ernment, and Freedom was his land.'"" Old John Killens.

This is our aim. It's rough, we have to smooth it up some. But we're not trying to put something together that's smooth. We don't care how rough it is. We don't care how tough it is. We don't care how backward it may sound. In essence it only means we want one thing. We declare our right on this earth to be a man, to be a human being, to be respected as a human being, to be given the rights of a human being in this society, on this earth, in this day, which we intend to bring into existence by any means necessary.

I'm sorry I took so long. But before we go farther to tell you how you can join this organization, what your duties and responsibilities are, I want to turn you back into the hands of our master of ceremonies, Brother Les Edmonds.

[A collection is taken. Malcolm resumes.]

One of the first steps we are going to become involved in as an Organization of Afro-American Unity will be to work with every leader and other organization in this country interested in a program designed to bring your and my problem before the United Nations. This is our first point of business. We feel that the problem of the black man in this country is beyond the ability of Uncle Sam to solve it. It's beyond the ability of the United States government to solve it. The government itself isn't capable of even hearing our problem, much less solving it. It's not morally equipped to solve it.

So we must take it out of the hands of the United States government. And the only way we can do this is by internationalizing it and taking advantage of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Charter on Human Rights, and on that ground bring it into the UN before a world body where¬ in we can indict Uncle Sam for the continued criminal injustices that our people experience in this government.

To do this, we will have to work with many organizations and many people. We've already gotten promises of support from many different organizations in this country and from many different leaders in this country and from many different independent nations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. So this is our first objective and all we need is your support. Can we get your support for this project?

For the past four weeks since my return from Africa, several persons from all walks of life in the Afro-American community have been meeting together, pooling knowledge and ideas and suggestions, forming a sort of a brain trust, for the purpose of getting a cross section of thinking, hopes, aspirations, likes and dislikes, to see what kind of organization we could put together that would in some way or other get the grass roots support, and what type of support it would need in order to be independent enough to take the type of action necessary to get results.
No organization that is financed by white support can ever be independent enough to fight the power structure with the type of tactics necessary to get real results. The only way we can fight the power structure, and it's the power structure that we're fighting we're not even fighting the Southern segregationists, we're fighting a system that is run in Washington, D. C. That's the seat of the system that we're fighting. And in order to fight it, we have to be independent of it. And the only way we can be independent of it is to be independent of all support from the white community. It's a battle that we have to wage ourselves.

Now, if white people want to help, they can help. But they can't join. They can help in the white community, but they can't join. We accept their help. They can form the White Friends of the Organization of Afro-American Unity and work in the white community on white people and change their attitude toward us. They don't ever need to come among us and change our attitude. We've had enough of them working around us trying to change our attitude. That's what got us all messed up. So we don't question their sincerity, we don't question their motives, we don't question their integrity. We just encourage them to use it somewhere else in the white community. If they can use all of this sincerity in the white community to make the white community act better toward us, then we'll say, ""Those are good white folks."" But they don't have to come around us, smiling at us and showing us all their teeth like white Uncle Toms, to try and make themselves acceptable to us. The White Friends of the Organization of Afro American Unity, let them work in the white community.

The only way that this organization can be independent is if it is financed by you. It must be financed by you. Last week I told you that it would cost a dollar to join it. We sat down and thought about it all week long and said that charging you a dollar to join it would not make it an organization. We have set a membership joining fee, if that's the way you express it, at $2.00. It costs more than that, I think, to join the NAACP.

By the way, you know I attended the NAACP convention Friday in Washington, D. C., which was very enlightening. And I found the people very friendly. They've got the same kind of ideas you have. They act a little different, but they've got the same kind of ideas, because they're catching the same hell we're catching. I didn't find any hostility at that convention at all. In fact, I sat and listened to them go through their business and learned a lot from it. And one of the things I learned is they only charge, I think, $2.50 a year for membership, and that's it. Well, this is one of the reasons that they have problems. Because any time you have an organization that costs $2.50 a year to belong to, it means that that organization has to turn in another direction for funds. And this is what castrates it. Because as soon as the white liberals begin to support it, they tell it what to do and what not to do.

This is why Garvey was able to be more militant. Garvey didn't ask them for help. He asked our people for help. And this is what we're going to do. We're going to try and follow his books.

So we're going to have a $2.00 joining fee and ask every member to contribute a dollar a week. Now, the NAACP gets $2.50 a year, that's it. And it can't ever go anywhere like that because it's always got to be putting on some kind of drive for help and will always get its help from the wrong source. And then when they get that help, they'll have to end up condemning all the enemies of their enemy in order to get some more help. No, we condemn our enemies, not the enemies of our enemies. We condemn our enemies.

So what we are going to ask you to do is, if you want to become a member of the Organization of Afro-American Unity, it will cost you $2.00. We are going to ask you to pay a dues of a dollar a week. We will have an accountant, a bookkeeping system, which will keep the members up to date as to what has come in, what has been spent, and for what. Because the secret to success in any kind of business venture – and anything that you do that you mean business, you'd better do in a businesslike way – the secret to your success is keeping good records, good organized records.

Since today will be the first time that we are opening the books for membership, our next meeting will be next Sunday here. And we will then have a membership. And we'll be able to announce at that time the officers of the Organization of Afro-American Unity. I'll tell you the top officer is the chairman, and that's the office I'm holding. I'm taking the responsibility of the chairman, which means I'm responsible for any mistakes that take place; anything that goes wrong, any failures, you can rest them right upon my shoulders. So next week the officers will be announced.

And this week I wanted to tell you the departments in this organization that, when you take out your membership, you can apply to work in. We have the department of education. The department of political action. For all of you who are interested in political action, we will have a department set up by brothers and sisters who are students of political science, whose function it will be to give us a breakdown of the community of New York City. First, how many assemblymen there are and how many of those assemblymen are black, how many congressmen there are and how many of those congressmen are black. In fact, let me just read something real quick and I'll show you why it's so necessary. Just to give you an example.

There are 270,000 eligible voters in the twenty first senatorial district. The twenty first senatorial district is broken down into the eleventh, seventh, and thirteenth assembly districts. Each assembly district contains 90,000 eligible voters. In the eleventh assembly district, only 29,000 out of 90,000 eligible voters exercise their voting rights. In the seventh assembly district, only 36,000 out of the 90,000 eligible voters vote. Now, in a white assembly district with 90,000 eligible voters, 65,000 exercise their voting rights, showing you that in the white assembly districts more whites vote than blacks vote in the black assembly districts. There's a reason for this. It is because our people aren't politically aware of what we can get by becoming politically active.

So what we have to have is a program of political education to show them what they can get if they take political action that's intelligently directed. Less than 25 percent of the eligible voters in Harlem vote in the primary election. Therefore, they have not the right to place the candidate of their choice in office, as only those who were in the primary can run in the general election. The following number of signatures are required to place a candidate to vote in the primaries: for assemblyman it must be 350 signatures; state senator, 750; countywide judgeship, 1,000; borough president, 2,250; mayor, 7,500. People registered with the Republican or Democratic parties do not have to vote with their party.

There are fifty eight senators in the New York state legislature. Four are from Manhattan; one is black. In the New York state assembly, there are 150 assemblymen. I think three are black; maybe more than that. According to calculation, if the Negro were proportionately represented in the state senate and state assembly, we would have several representatives in the state senate and several in the state assembly. There are 435 members in the United States House of Representatives. According to the census, there are 22 million Afro Americans in the United States. If they were represented proportionately in this body, there would be 30 to 40 members of our race sitting in that body. How many are there? Five. There are 100 senators in the United States Senate. Hawaii, with a population of only 600 thousand, has two senators representing it. The black man, with a population of in excess of 20 million, is not represented in the Senate at all. Worse than this, many of the congressmen and representatives in the Congress of the United States come from states where black people are killed if they attempt to exercise the right to vote.

What you and I want to do in this political department is have our brothers and sisters who are experts in the science of politics acquaint our people in our community with what we should have, and who should be doing it, and how we can go about getting what we should have. This will be their job and we want you to play this role so we can get some action without having to wait on Lyndon B. Johnson, Lyndon B. Texas Johnson.

Also, our economics department. We have an economics department. For any of you who are interested in business or a program that will bring about a situation where the black man in Harlem can gain control over his own economy and develop business expansion for our people in this community so we can create some employment opportunities for our people in this community, we will have this department.

We will also have a speakers bureau because many of our people want to speak, want to be speakers, they want to preach, they want to tell somebody what they know, they want to let off some steam. We will have a department that will train young men and young women how to go forth with our philosophy and our program and project it throughout the country; not only throughout this city but throughout the country.
We will have a youth group. The youth group will be designed to work with youth. Not only will it consist of youth, but it will also consist of adults. But it will be designed to work out a program for the youth in this country, one in which the youth can play an active part.

We also are going to have our own newspaper. You need a newspaper. We believe in the power of the press. A newspaper is not a difficult thing to run. A newspaper is very simple if you have the right motives. In fact, anything is simple if you have the right motives. The Muhammad Speaks newspaper, I and another person started it myself in my basement. And I've never gone past the eighth grade. Those of you who have gone to all these colleges and studied all kinds of journalism, yellow and black journalism, all you have to do is contribute some of your journalistic talent to our newspaper department along with our research department, and we can turn out a newspaper that will feed our people with so much information that we can bring about a real live revolution right here before you know it.

We will also have a cultural department. The task or duty of the cultural department will be to do research into the culture, into the ancient and current culture of our people, the cultural contributions and achievements of our people. And also all of the entertainment groups that exist on the African continent that can come here and ours who are here that can go there. Set up some kind of cultural program that will really emphasize the dormant talent of black people.

When I was in Ghana I was speaking with, I think his name is Nana Nketsia, I think he's the minister of culture or he's head of the culture institute. I went to his house, he had a – he had a nice, beautiful place; I started to say he had a sharp pad. He had a fine place in Accra. He had gone to Oxford, and one of the things that he said impressed me no end. He said that as an African his concept of freedom is a situation or a condition in which he, as an African, feels completely free to give vent to his own likes and dislikes and thereby develop his own African personality. Not a condition in which he is copying some European cultural pattern or some European cultural standard, but an atmosphere of complete freedom where he has the right, the leeway, to bring out of himself all of that dormant, hidden talent that has been there for so long.

And in that atmosphere, brothers and sisters, you'd be surprised what will come out of the bosom of this black man. I've seen it happen. I've seen black musicians when they'd be jamming at a jam session with white musicians – a whole lot of difference. The white musician can jam if he's got some sheet music in front of him. He can jam on something that he's heard jammed before. If he's heard it, then he can duplicate it or he can imitate it or he can read it But that black musician, he picks up his horn and starts blowing some sounds that he never thought of before. He improvises, he creates, it comes from within. It's his soul, it's that soul music. It's the only area on the American scene
where the black man has been free to create. And he his mastered it. He has shown that he can come up with something that nobody ever thought of on his horn.

Well, likewise he can do the same thing if given intellectual independence. He can come up with a new philosophy. He can come up with a philosophy that nobody has heard of yet. He can invent a society, a social system, an economic system, a political system, that is different from anything that exists or has ever existed anywhere on this earth. He will improvise; he'll bring it from within himself. And this is what you and I want.

You and I want to create an organization that will give us so much power we can sit down and do as we please. Once we can sit down and think as we please, speak as we please, and do as we please, we will show people what pleases us. And what pleases us won't always please them. So you've got to get some power before you can be yourself. Do you understand that? You've got to get some power before you can be yourself. Once you get power and you be yourself, why, you're gone, you've got it and gone. You create a new society and make some heaven right here on this earth.

And we're going to start right here tonight when we open up our membership books into the Organization of Afro-American Unity. I'm going to buy the first memberships myself – one for me, my wife, Attillah, Qubilah, these are my daughters, Ilyasah, and something else I expect to get either this week or next week. As I told you before, if it's a boy I'm going to name him Lumumba, the greatest black man who ever walked the African continent.

He didn't fear anybody. He had those people so scared they had to kill him. They couldn't buy him, they couldn't frighten him, they couldn't reach him. Why, he told the king of Belgium, ""Man, you may let us free, you may have given us our independence, but we can never forget these scars."" The greatest speech – you should take that speech and tack it up over your door. This is what Lumumba said: ""You aren't giving us anything. Why, can you take back these scars that you put on our bodies? Can you give us back the limbs that you cut off while you were here?"" No, you should never forget what that man did to you. And you bear the scars of the same kind of colonization and oppression not on your body, but in your brain, in your heart, in your soul, right now.
So, if it's a boy, Lumumba. If it's a girl, Lumumbah.

[Malcolm introduces several people from the platform and from the audience, then continues:]

If I passed over some of the rest of you, it's because my eyes aren't too good, my glasses aren't too good. But everybody here are people who are from the street who want some kind of action. We hope that we will be able to give you all the action you need. And more than likely we'll be able to give you more than you want. We just hope that you stay with us. Our meeting will be next Sunday night right here. We want you to bring all of your friends and we'll be able to go forward. Up until now, these meetings have been sponsored by the Muslim Mosque, Inc. They've been sponsored and paid for by the Muslim Mosque, Inc. Beginning next Sunday, they will be sponsored and paid for by the Organization of Afro American Unity.

I don't know if I'm right in saying this, but for a period of time, let's you and me not be too hard on other Afro-American leaders. Because you would be surprised how many of them. have expressed sympathy and support in our efforts to bring this situation confronting our people before the United Nations. You'd be surprised how many of them, some of the last ones you would expect, they're coming around. So let's give them a little time to straighten up. If they straighten up, good. They're our brothers and we're responsible for our brothers. But if they don't straighten up, then that's another point.

And one thing that we are going to do, we're going to dispatch a wire, a telegram that is, in the name of the Organization of Afro-American Unity to Martin Luther King in St. Augustine, Florida, and to Jim Forman in Mississippi, worded in essence to tell them that if the federal government doesn't come to their aid, call on us. And we will take the responsibility of slipping some brothers into that area who know what to do by any means necessary.

I can tell you right now that my purpose is not to become involved in a fight with Black Muslims, who are my brothers still. I do everything I can to avoid that because there's no benefit in it. It actually makes our enemy happy. But I do believe that the time has come for you and me to take the responsibility of forming whatever nucleus or defense group is necessary in places like Mississippi. Why, they shouldn't have to call on the federal government – that's a drag. No, when you and I know that our people are the victims of brutality, and all times the police in those states are the ones who are responsible, then it is incumbent upon you and me, if we are men, if we are to be respected and recognized, it is our duty. . . [A passage is lost here through a defect in the tape.]

Johnson knew that when he sent [Allen] Dulles down there. Johnson has found this out. You don't disappear. How are you going to disappear? Why, this man can find a missing person in China. They send the CIA all the way to China and find somebody. They send the FBI anywhere and find somebody. But they can't find them whenever the criminal is white and the victim is black, then they can't find them.

Let's don't wait on any more FBI to look for criminals who are shooting and brutalizing our people. Let's you and me find them. And I say that it's easy to do it. One of the best organized groups of black people in America was the Black Muslims. They've got all the machinery, don't think they haven't; and the experience where they know how to ease out in broad daylight or in dark and do whatever is necessary by any means necessary. They know how to do that. Well, I don't blame anybody for being taught how to do that. You're living in a society where you're the constant victim of brutality. You must know how to strike back.

So instead of them and us wasting our shots, I should say our time and energy, on each other, what we need to do is band together and go to Mississippi. That's my closing message to Elijah Muhammad: If he is the leader of the Muslims and the leader of our people, then lead us against our enemies, don't lead us against each other.

I thank you for your patience here tonight, and we want each and every one of you to put your name on the roll of the Organization of Afro- American Unity. The reason we have to rely upon you to let the public know where we are is because the press doesn't help us; they never announce in advance that we're going to have a meeting. So you have to spread the word over the grapevine. Thank you. Salaam Alaikum.",2450854,en,en,en

Heyo..
The nine element culture, Hip Hop
Taught me to speak my heart
Told me to speak my mind
Speak my soul..
But you ain’t on my level
If you’re spitting lies on the mic
Talking bout a life you don’t lead
Imma show you how its really done!

These days I be seeing the scene
Every other rapper claiming to be killing the beat
Now, go on a take a backseat
And walk the backstreets like a real deadbeat

New kid on the block it is
Promising as old school hip hop it is
No apologies, no amends
I’m just here to defy the trends
So don’t flex when you ain’t got that syllable ability
My rhymes flex for me with credibility
F*ck your sipping hennessey
And living in luxury
I be spitting my rhymes and they be
Killing all these enemies
I level up the game
With the rhymes overflowing from a mind so insane
Witness the renascence of the Dark Knight
And his enterprise;
And the crushing of Bane at the hands of
Bruce Wayne!

History of hip-hop is a blank page
For these whack rappers killing in the name of road rage
The six letters mean a movement so big
Don’t you confine it to a lil bounce, lil jig

Am like a refugee in this rap game
Gonna leave scars on you like Tony Montana
Be a cult, not shoot for mainstream glory
And smoke you on a Cuban, like its Havana..

Stand tall never crawl
Try and look me in the eye
You ain’t on my level f*cking level up
I freeze time; with my rhymes each time
Game time, flow sublime on my prime
Thats a paradigm;
Subliminal shots fall back in the line
Like the worth of a dime

Plug in the cable, flip that turntable
I give you a rhyme so hard makes you unstable
Leaves you unable to fire back
And if you think you did
Then you’re just a fable

कलाकारी मेरी ऐसी करू तेरी ऐसी की तैसी कभी मानु ना हार मैं
On the mic
(My skills supreme, they're gonna take you down; I never give up on the mic)
बुनु शब्दों का जाल करू बेबस इन्हें मैं
(I spin a web of words that make you helpless)
Rise to the power like the Fourth Reich

खेल नहीं खेलूं करू मैं हमला lyrically
(I play no games, straight fire with my lyrics)
Spit करू सच लगे कड़वा
(I spit the truth and it feels bitter)
तू करे fire shots in हड़बड़ी
(You fire shots in a rush)
With your inflated ego, I be ‘yeah sully’
Underground for a reason
Mainstream more like an act of treason
No to the charts and the play with the figures
Your focus on a single match but I go
Winning whole season

Pulp fiction life and am the bad guy
The killing and the cussing and the drugs aside
Dare you and double dare you on this mic
With my lyrical bombs; feel the new divide

Don’t care bout the spotlight when my game right
Poised is my pen, verses are airtight
You think that your scene strong, all you do is backbite
Like a hater playing, out of mind, out of sight

हर बार बोलेगा तोह कब सुनेगा
(When would you listen and stop your blabber)
पहेली मेरा rap है और सर तेरा घूमेगा

Boom box जैसे बजे मेरा flow

Makes me smile all the while
Whenever I'm with you, girl

While we dance, make romance
I'm enchanted by the
Things that you do

Oh, oh, oh...

I love music
Sweet, sweet music
Long as it's swinging
All the joy that it's bringing
I'm so happy to be
In complete harmony
I love you, girl

And to hold you
So close in my arms
I'm so glad that
You're mine, all mine

Nothing can be better
Than a sweet love song
So sweet, so sweet
So mellow, mellow

When you got the girl
That you love in your armss
Honey, I love you
I love you, yeah

Music is the healing
Force of the world
It's understood by every man
Woman, boy and girl

And that's why
That's why I say
I love music
Any kind of music
I love music
Just as long as it's
Grooving, grooving
Music makes the
Atmosphere so fine
Lights down low
Just me and you
Baby, you know

Especially when you got
A cold glass of wine
Mellow, mellow wine and song

I love music
Any, any kind of music
I love music
Just as long as it's grooving

And I say I love, I love
I love, I love, I love music
Sweet, sweet music

The two shall become one
The prophet so pathetic
Now cast them down in stone

Waiting for eternity

These messages sent from the dead

Brought down by acts of hate

Chapter 30: Beowulf Narrates His Adventures To Higelac,misc,Beowulf,2012,734,{},"“It well may discomfit the prince of the Heathobards
And each of the thanemen of earls that attend him,
When he goes to the building escorting the woman,
That a noble-born Daneman the knights should be feasting:
There gleam on his person the leavings of elders

Hard and ring-bright, Heathobards’ treasure,
While they wielded their arms, till they misled to the battle
Their own dear lives and belovèd companions.
He saith at the banquet who the collar beholdeth,
An ancient ash-warrior who earlmen’s destruction

Clearly recalleth (cruel his spirit),
Sadly beginneth sounding the youthful
Thane-champion’s spirit through the thoughts of his bosom,
War-grief to waken, and this word-answer speaketh:
‘Art thou able, my friend, to know when thou seest it

The brand which thy father bare to the conflict
In his latest adventure, ’neath visor of helmet,
The dearly-loved iron, where Danemen did slay him,
And brave-mooded Scyldings, on the fall of the heroes,
(When vengeance was sleeping) the slaughter-place wielded?
E’en now some man of the murderer’s progeny
Exulting in ornaments enters the building,
Boasts of his blood-shedding, offbeareth the jewel
Which thou shouldst wholly hold in possession!’
So he urgeth and mindeth on every occasion

With woe-bringing words, till waxeth the season
When the woman’s thane for the works of his father,
The bill having bitten, blood-gory sleepeth,
Fated to perish; the other one thenceward
’Scapeth alive, the land knoweth thoroughly.

Then the oaths of the earlmen on each side are broken,
When rancors unresting are raging in Ingeld
And his wife-love waxeth less warm after sorrow.
So the Heathobards’ favor not faithful I reckon,
Their part in the treaty not true to the Danemen,

Their friendship not fast. I further shall tell thee
More about Grendel, that thou fully mayst hear,
Ornament-giver, what afterward came from
The hand-rush of heroes. When heaven’s bright jewel
O’er earthfields had glided, the stranger came raging,

The horrible night-fiend, us for to visit,
Where wholly unharmed the hall we were guarding.
To Hondscio happened a hopeless contention,
Death to the doomed one, dead he fell foremost,
Girded war-champion; to him Grendel became then,
To the vassal distinguished, a tooth-weaponed murderer,
The well-beloved henchman’s body all swallowed.
Not the earlier off empty of hand did
The bloody-toothed murderer, mindful of evils,
Wish to escape from the gold-giver’s palace,

But sturdy of strength he strove to outdo me,
Hand-ready grappled. A glove was suspended
Spacious and wondrous, in art-fetters fastened,
Which was fashioned entirely by touch of the craftman
From the dragon’s skin by the devil’s devices:

He down in its depths would do me unsadly
One among many, deed-doer raging,
Though sinless he saw me; not so could it happen
When I in my anger upright did stand.
’Tis too long to recount how requital I furnished

For every evil to the earlmen’s destroyer;
’Twas there, my prince, that I proudly distinguished
Thy land with my labors. He left and retreated,
He lived his life a little while longer:
Yet his right-hand guarded his footstep in Heorot,

And sad-mooded thence to the sea-bottom fell he,
Mournful in mind. For the might-rush of battle
The friend of the Scyldings, with gold that was plated,
With ornaments many, much requited me,
When daylight had dawned, and down to the banquet
We had sat us together. There was chanting and joyance:
The age-stricken Scylding asked many questions
And of old-times related; oft light-ringing harp-strings,
Joy-telling wood, were touched by the brave one;
Now he uttered measures, mourning and truthful,

Then the large-hearted land-king a legend of wonder
Truthfully told us. Now troubled with years
The age-hoary warrior afterward began to
Mourn for the might that marked him in youth-days;
His breast within boiled, when burdened with winters

Much he remembered. From morning till night then
We joyed us therein as etiquette suffered,
Till the second night season came unto earth-folk.
Then early thereafter, the mother of Grendel
Was ready for vengeance, wretched she journeyed;

Her son had death ravished, the wrath of the Geatmen.
The horrible woman avengèd her offspring,
And with mighty mainstrength murdered a hero.
There the spirit of Æschere, agèd adviser,
Was ready to vanish; nor when morn had lightened

Were they anywise suffered to consume him with fire,
Folk of the Danemen, the death-weakened hero,
Nor the belovèd liegeman to lay on the pyre;
She the corpse had offcarried in the clutch of the foeman
’Neath mountain-brook’s flood. To Hrothgar ’twas saddest

Of pains that ever had preyed on the chieftain;
By the life of thee the land-prince then me3
Besought very sadly, in sea-currents’ eddies
To display my prowess, to peril my safety,
Might-deeds accomplish; much did he promise.

I found then the famous flood-current’s cruel,
Horrible depth-warder. A while unto us two
Hand was in common; the currents were seething
With gore that was clotted, and Grendel’s fierce mother’s
Head I offhacked in the hall at the bottom

With huge-reaching sword-edge, hardly I wrested
My life from her clutches; not doomed was I then,
But the warden of earlmen afterward gave me
Jewels in quantity, kinsman of Healfdene.",92371,en,en,en

The Mountain Whippoorwill,misc,Stephen Vincent Bent,2015,1539,"{""Stephen Vincent Benét""}","Up in the mountains, it's lonesome all the time,
(Sof' win' slewin' thu' the sweet-potato vine.)
Up in the mountains, it's lonesome for a child,
(Whippoorwills a-callin' when the sap runs wild.)
Up in the mountains, mountains in the fog,
Everythin's as lazy as an old houn' dog.
Born in the mountains, never raised a pet,
Don't want nuthin' an' never got it yet.
Born in the mountains, lonesome-born,
Raised runnin' ragged thu' the cockleburrs and corn.
Never knew my pappy, mebbe never should.
Think he was a fiddle made of mountain laurel-wood.
Never had a mammy to teach me pretty-please.
Think she was a whippoorwill, a-skittin' thu' the trees.
Never had a brother ner a whole pair of pants,
But when I start to fiddle, why, yuh got to start to dance!
Listen to my fiddle -- Kingdom Come -- Kingdom Come!
Hear the frogs a-chunkin' ""Jug o' rum, Jug o' rum!""
Hear that mountain whippoorwill be lonesome in the air,
An' I'll tell yuh how I travelled to the Essex County Fair.
Essex County has a mighty pretty fair,
All the smarty fiddlers from the South come there.
Elbows flyin' as they rosin up the bow
For the First Prize Contest in the Georgia Fiddlers' Show.
Old Dan Wheeling, with his whiskers in his ears,
King-pin fiddler for nearly twenty years.
Big Tom Sergeant, with his blue wall-eye,
An' Little Jimmy Weezer that can make a fiddle cry.
All sittin' roun', spittin' high an' struttin' proud,
(Listen, little whippoorwill, yuh better bug yore eyes!)
Tun-a-tun-a-tunin' while the jedges told the crowd
Them that got the mostest claps'd win the bestest prize.
Everybody waitin' for the first tweedle-dee,
When in comes a-stumblin' -- hill-billy me!
Bowed right pretty to the jedges an' the rest,
Took a silver dollar from a hole inside my vest,
Plunked it on the table an' said, ""There's my callin' card!
An' anyone that licks me -- well, he's got to fiddle hard!""
Old Dan Wheeling, he was laughin' fit to holler,
Little Jimmy Weezer said, ""There's one dead dollar!""
Big Tom Sergeant had a yaller-toothy grin,
But I tucked my little whippoorwill spang underneath my chin,
An' petted it an' tuned it till the jedges said, ""Begin!""
Big Tom Sargent was the first in line;
He could fiddle all the bugs off a sweet-potato vine.
He could fiddle down a possum from a mile-high tree,
He could fiddle up a whale from the bottom of the sea.
Yuh could hear hands spankin' till they spanked each other raw,
When he finished variations on ""Turkey in the Straw.""
Little Jimmy Weezer was the next to play;
He could fiddle all night, he could fiddle all day.
He could fiddle chills, he could fiddle fever,
He could make a fiddle rustle like a lowland river.
He could make a fiddle croon like a lovin' woman.
An' they clapped like thunder when he'd finished strummin'.
Then came the ruck of the bob-tailed fiddlers,
The let's-go-easies, the fair-to-middlers.
They got their claps an' they lost their bicker,
An' they all settled back for some more corn-licker.
An' the crowd was tired of their no-count squealing,
When out in the center steps Old Dan Wheeling.
He fiddled high and he fiddled low,
(Listen, little whippoorwill, yuh got to spread yore wings!)
He fiddled and fiddled with a cherrywood bow,
(Old Dan Wheeling's got bee-honey in his strings).
He fiddled a wind by the lonesome moon,
He fiddled a most almighty tune.
He started fiddling like a ghost.
He ended fiddling like a host.
He fiddled north an' he fiddled south,
He fiddled the heart right out of yore mouth.
He fiddled here an' he fiddled there.
He fiddled salvation everywhere.
When he was finished, the crowd cut loose,
(Whippoorwill, they's rain on yore breast.)
An' I sat there wonderin' ""What's the use?""
(Whippoorwill, fly home to yore nest.)
But I stood up pert an' I took my bow,
An' my fiddle went to my shoulder, so.
An' -- they wasn't no crowd to get me fazed --
But I was alone where I was raised.
Up in the mountains, so still it makes yuh skeered.
Where God lies sleepin' in his big white beard.
An' I heard the sound of the squirrel in the pine,
An' I heard the earth a-breathin' thu' the long night-time.
They've fiddled the rose, and they've fiddled the thorn,
But they haven't fiddled the mountain-corn.
They've fiddled sinful an' fiddled moral,
But they haven't fiddled the breshwood-laurel.
They've fiddled loud, and they've fiddled still,
But they haven't fiddled the whippoorwill.
I started off with a dump-diddle-dump,
(Oh, hell's broke loose in Georgia!)
Skunk-cabbage growin' by the bee-gum stump.
(Whippoorwill, yo're singin' now!)
My mother was a whippoorwill pert,
My father, he was lazy,
But I'm hell broke loose in a new store shirt
To fiddle all Georgia crazy.
Swing yore partners -- up an' down the middle!
Sashay now -- oh, listen to that fiddle!
Flapjacks flippin' on a red-hot griddle,
An' hell's broke loose,
Hell's broke loose,
Fire on the mountains -- snakes in the grass.
Satan's here a-bilin' -- oh, Lordy, let him pass!
Go down Moses, set my people free;
Pop goes the weasel thu' the old Red Sea!
Jonah sittin' on a hickory-bough,
Up jumps a whale -- an' where's yore prophet now?
Rabbit in the pea-patch, possum in the pot,
Try an' stop my fiddle, now my fiddle's gettin' hot!
Whippoorwill, singin' thu' the mountain hush,
Whippoorwill, shoutin' from the burnin' bush,

Sing till yuh bust the gold in yore throat!

Bound to stop yore music if yuh don't sing it down.
Sing on the mountains, little whippoorwill,
Sing to the valleys, an' slap 'em with a hill,
For I'm struttin' high as an eagle's quill,
An' hell's broke loose,
Hell's broke loose,
Hell's broke loose in Georgia!
They wasn't a sound when I stopped bowin',
(Whippoorwill, yuh can sing no more.)
But, somewhere or other, the dawn was growin',
(Oh, mountain whippoorwill!)

Yo're a good hill-billy, but yuh've been bossed.""
So I went to congratulate old man Dan,

Paying last night's tab with the afternoon

But she didn't stay
Didn't have to say I didn't want her to
Didn't leave a number for me to lose

Give me something for my head
Or a text from a friend
And I'll go fucking do it again

But I never do

Then ill need a shot
And I'll take 3 more
Cuz I'm afraid to stop
Then I need a smoke
Cause I got too drunk
Now I better find a bag if I'm gonna keep up

I don't really regret, just try to forget
I feel like I've written this song before
A thousand times
With the same emotion just a different storyline
Like nothing else matters
My glass house is shattered
Man, I just wish that I had her in my arms once again
Instead of this pen
I swear if I could
I'd stick around until the end
But why try and pretend
I'd rather catch up on sleep
Cos Lord knows, that that's what I need

That I be expressing

About being by myself

But I guess I was just used to you
And new to news that I didn't want to hear
But now my vision is clear
And you're no longer here
And there's no tears that were shed off these eyelids
My love life is lifeless
But goddamn I like it
But never fighting the forces of nature got me thinking
That maybe since I'm no longer high
I'll start sinking in the abyss I created
I think about my life
And I don't really hate it
Just wish that I could escape it

I usually keep it closed
Cos this is what my mouth do
I woke up late for work
And just decide to quit

And it's hard to explain
In how to deal with the pain
And it's hard to contain

Yet, it all feels the same

She said it will be okay
Just breathe in and let it go

[Verse 1]
Welcome to my dreamy atmosphere
No one's here, not a single peer
Mistakes are forever here
And yet I still smell beer
One shot, all gone
The next day, I am anon
Is this real, probably not
Is she here, I hope not
Still here after the afterparty
Still no difference cause I'm not Mr. Smarty
I callеd into to work to say I'm not there
They thеy ask ""where the hell is Clare""?
Oop, I forgot, do I have a spare?
They shout, go find her before we declare
So I'm here thinking about my own little world
I don't know, I just like to have fun
[Verse 2]
I have dreams that seem impossible most of the time
But yet I'm still working like I'm on the crime
Making music is the shit, I'm not giving up
Even if they don't like it, look close up
You'll see the bigger picture rather than one click
Yes, I make projects that go harder than my tricks
Just let me focus
Clutching in for the kiss
Here's a little tip
Give it a little kick
Heard a lot of y'all don't really like this shit
I'm still learning even after the eighteen bit
But this is number nineteen, the bonus one
You really made it through to hear me rap this one
My dreamy atmosphere is very different from this world
Where I can be the one to make it all twirl
It's just an imagination
Right?

[Verse 2]
Welcome to my dreamy atmosphere
I'm the only one who's living here
It gets very lonely often
So I make use of the time to make the pain soften
And I'm still not done yet
I'll leave soon, wanna bet?
I'll go outside and enjoy nature while I can
Cause I never when they will start the ban

To when I thought you was fire

How you entered my life and that car you drive
Takin a slim chance just shooting some dice
And how we worried bout nothin
And said let's let time decide
Brought out the best in me and I swallowed my pride
I won't forget it
Know I promised that I'd never sweat it
I'd be lying if I said it ain't fill my head up
On God
No I'll never regret it
All of the time we spent
Just know you made a dent and not bad one
All I ever wanted was to say that I had one
Bet you never noticed it was the littlest moments
That made the closest

I ain't trippin' nor flippin', I'm just liquor sippin'
At the bar, tippin' wit your money, can you pay the difference?
It seems like it's a waste of time, that's why I wrote the rhyme
I hear you jump in every car, except for mines
Nigga, I don't jump in cars, I'm a superstar
Face way to flaw, you should hang me on your wall
All I do all day is drink Tanqueray
Thinking of a way to put a smile on your face
Make me smile, see them teeth, me look cute down to them features
My waste, my physique, me don't want freak-a-leek
Should I wine and dine? You put ring on your fingers
While sex from the next man in the bedroom lingers
Sex will never linger, hold up, put up the blinkers
I flow just like sprinklers, give yo ass the middle finger

That you're lying in a bean bag!
You're in a Big house
In a big loungeroom
And, judging by the light creeping in the window
It's about 4 or 5 in the morning!
Empty bottles thrown about
Cheese and crackers and dips used as ashtrays
Intimate clothing strewn about
A lampshade gone awry

Where am I?
Is this my house?
Whose house is this?

When you gotta go
You gotta go
Make sure you gotta go
Real slow

Stand up!
Well you decide
To get up out of that bean bag
And make your way to the front door
But when you go to move you discover that your legs are filled with concrete
They are heavier than the columns out front the National Department of Defence
You look down
A tom tom drum
Arrives playing in your head
A bird cage that hasn't been cleaned in two years
Moves into the roof of your mouth
Hey, it's time to go
It's time to do
The limbo
The hokey pokey
Do the limbo
Mind how you go

When you gotta go
You gotta go
Make sure you gotta go
Real slow

Stand up!

Stand up you fool
Can't you walk?
Lift those legs, come on
Do the hokey pokey, it's time to go
What did they put in that drink?
What did they put in that drink?
What did they put in that drink?
Whose house is this?
Did i go to some swingin' suburban party last night?
What did they put in that drink?
When you gotta go
You gotta go
Make sure you gotta go
Real slow

Stand up!

And walk
That's alright for you to say
I can't move legs!
Maybe if i crawled all the way to the built in robes
And locked myself in the cupboard and climbed up the walls;
Maybe I'd be surrounded by golf slacks, personal organisers, master chef kitchens ,suburban art and decking

What did they put in that drink?
Is there any train station in this suburb, I dunno...?

Took my heart, to leave me nothing but a piece of paper. (yeah you spoke to me)
Told me to smile when things get blue, and when you feel really shitty just act like life is cool. But I can't, because shit hasn't been the same without you

Envy,rap,Zoan,2022,2,{},"He has more than me
She has more than me
He's more beloved
She’s more beloved
I feel so ugly
Lord, I know I shouldn't covet
But damn
He's truly living the life
And that makes me feel
Fucking shitty, depressed, and angry
About mine

Those who don’t have
Might feel a type of way
With does that do
What I possess
What I embody
What I live
Might make you feel
A type of way about you
The attitude
To those that are possessed
Will make you hate yourself
And lеave you feeling upset
Becausе if a man gets to eat a feast
I understand that it's hard to appreciate your daily bread
Envy is stupid
Cause if you want what he or she has
Go out and get it
God rewards the faithful
And you reap what you sow
It's a damn shame
How quick they be forgetting
Don't put in the work
And don't put in the time
Then you have no damn right
To be angry with the reality of your life
And feel a type of way towards
What is that of others and that of mine
I know I possess
Talents and creativity
Along with intelligence
That is on the level of a God
Funny how I can display all that
And they'll resort
To accusing me
As an imposter and a fraud
My cup is full
Yalls be empty
I'm happy being me
But these foos are filled with envy
I can understand why niggas feel a type of way
Towards a chink ass gook whose a better
Emcee
I can't spit like Zoan
I can’t create like Zoan
So the envy in them
Keeps on growing
To the point of going
Down a path
Which makes them resort to
Pitiful ass moves
But the fact that
You don’t have faith and believe
That you can make something of yourself
Is the reason why
These haters of mine
Will keep living pitiful lives
And will forever stay where they're at
And only know how to lose
Envy will make you do a lot of things... like slander a hard working, talented, kind-hearted King... Envy will make you do a lot of things... like spread lies and false rumors and give false accounts so that someone that’s beloved will be less loved... Envy will make you do a lot of things, like deciding to become enemies with someone that truly wants peace, unity, and utopia... Envy will make you do a lot of things, like harass, disrespect, bully, and hate someone who is pure of heart and full of love... Envy will make you do a lot of things

Sit me down and say you're having a baby
You caught me off of my guard

And then Dad came running through the yard

You had faith that even I could one day be made whole

And you kept me afloat when the waters were deep

So I'll do what I can to be the brother you need

William Faulkner’s “A Rose For Emily” archived 12,misc,Mr. Bonk,2013,162,{},"WHEN Miss Emily Grierson died, our whole town went to her funeral: the men through a sort of respectful affection for a fallen monument, the women mostly out of curiosity to see the inside of her house, which no one save an old man-servant--a combined gardener and cook--had seen in at least ten years.

It was a big, squarish frame house that had once been white, decorated with cupolas and spires and scrolled balconies in the heavily lightsome style of the seventies, set on what had once been our most select street. But garages and cotton gins had encroached and obliterated even the august names of that neighborhood; only Miss Emily's house was left, lifting its stubborn and coquettish decay above the cotton wagons and the gasoline pumps-an eyesore among eyesores. And now Miss Emily had gone to join the representatives of those august names where they lay in the cedar-bemused cemetery among the ranked and anonymous graves of Union and Confederate soldiers who fell at the battle of Jefferson.

Alive, Miss Emily had been a tradition, a duty, and a care; a sort of hereditary obligation upon the town, dating from that day in 1894 when Colonel Sartoris, the mayor--he who fathered the edict that no Negro woman should appear on the streets without an apron-remitted her taxes, the dispensation dating from the death of her father on into perpetuity. Not that Miss Emily would have accepted charity. Colonel Sartoris invented an involved tale to the effect that Miss Emily's father had loaned money to the town, which the town, as a matter of business, preferred this way of repaying. Only a man of Colonel Sartoris' generation and thought could have invented it, and only a woman could have believed it.

When the next generation, with its more modern ideas, became mayors and aldermen, this arrangement created some little dissatisfaction. On the first of the year they mailed her a tax notice. February came, and there was no reply. They wrote her a formal letter, asking her to call at the sheriff's office at her convenience. A week later the mayor wrote her himself, offering to call or to send his car for her, and received in reply a note on paper of an archaic shape, in a thin, flowing calligraphy in faded ink, to the effect that she no longer went out at all. The tax notice was also enclosed, without comment.

They called a special meeting of the Board of Aldermen. A deputation waited upon her, knocked at the door through which no visitor had passed since she ceased giving china-painting lessons eight or ten years earlier. They were admitted by the old Negro into a dim hall from which a stairway mounted into still more shadow. It smelled of dust and disuse--a close, dank smell. The Negro led them into the parlor. It was furnished in heavy, leather-covered furniture. When the Negro opened the blinds of one window, they could see that the leather was cracked; and when they sat down, a faint dust rose sluggishly about their thighs, spinning with slow motes in the single sun-ray. On a tarnished gilt easel before the fireplace stood a crayon portrait of Miss Emily's father.

They rose when she entered--a small, fat woman in black, with a thin gold chain descending to her waist and vanishing into her belt, leaning on an ebony cane with a tarnished gold head. Her skeleton was small and spare; perhaps that was why what would have been merely plumpness in another was obesity in her. She looked bloated, like a body long submerged in motionless water, and of that pallid hue. Her eyes, lost in the fatty ridges of her face, looked like two small pieces of coal pressed into a lump of dough as they moved from one face to another while the visitors stated their errand.

She did not ask them to sit. She just stood in the door and listened quietly until the spokesman came to a stumbling halt. Then they could hear the invisible watch ticking at the end of the gold chain.

Her voice was dry and cold. ""I have no taxes in Jefferson. Colonel Sartoris explained it to me. Perhaps one of you can gain access to the city records and satisfy yourselves.""

""But we have. We are the city authorities, Miss Emily. Didn't you get a notice from the sheriff, signed by him?""

""I received a paper, yes,"" Miss Emily said. ""Perhaps he considers himself the sheriff . . . I have no taxes in Jefferson.""

""But there is nothing on the books to show that, you see We must go by the--""
""See Colonel Sartoris. I have no taxes in Jefferson.""

""But, Miss Emily--""

""See Colonel Sartoris."" (Colonel Sartoris had been dead almost ten years.) ""I have no taxes in Jefferson. Tobe!"" The Negro appeared. ""Show these gentlemen out.""

II

So SHE vanquished them, horse and foot, just as she had vanquished their fathers thirty years before about the smell.

That was two years after her father's death and a short time after her sweetheart--the one we believed would marry her --had deserted her. After her father's death she went out very little; after her sweetheart went away, people hardly saw her at all. A few of the ladies had the temerity to call, but were not received, and the only sign of life about the place was the Negro man--a young man then--going in and out with a market basket.

""Just as if a man--any man--could keep a kitchen properly, ""the ladies said; so they were not surprised when the smell developed. It was another link between the gross, teeming world and the high and mighty Griersons.

A neighbor, a woman, complained to the mayor, Judge Stevens, eighty years old.

""But what will you have me do about it, madam?"" he said.

""Why, send her word to stop it,"" the woman said. ""Isn't there a law? ""

""I'm sure that won't be necessary,"" Judge Stevens said. ""It's probably just a snake or a rat that nigger of hers killed in the yard. I'll speak to him about it.""

The next day he received two more complaints, one from a man who came in diffident deprecation. ""We really must do something about it, Judge. I'd be the last one in the world to bother Miss Emily, but we've got to do something."" That night the Board of Aldermen met--three graybeards and one younger man, a member of the rising generation.

""It's simple enough,"" he said. ""Send her word to have her place cleaned up. Give her a certain time to do it in, and if she don't. ..""
""Dammit, sir,"" Judge Stevens said, ""will you accuse a lady to her face of smelling bad?""

So the next night, after midnight, four men crossed Miss Emily's lawn and slunk about the house like burglars, sniffing along the base of the brickwork and at the cellar openings while one of them performed a regular sowing motion with his hand out of a sack slung from his shoulder. They broke open the cellar door and sprinkled lime there, and in all the outbuildings. As they recrossed the lawn, a window that had been dark was lighted and Miss Emily sat in it, the light behind her, and her upright torso motionless as that of an idol. They crept quietly across the lawn and into the shadow of the locusts that lined the street. After a week or two the smell went away.

That was when people had begun to feel really sorry for her. People in our town, remembering how old lady Wyatt, her great-aunt, had gone completely crazy at last, believed that the Griersons held themselves a little too high for what they really were. None of the young men were quite good enough for Miss Emily and such. We had long thought of them as a tableau, Miss Emily a slender figure in white in the background, her father a spraddled silhouette in the foreground, his back to her and clutching a horsewhip, the two of them framed by the back-flung front door. So when she got to be thirty and was still single, we were not pleased exactly, but vindicated; even with insanity in the family she wouldn't have turned down all of her chances if they had really materialized.

When her father died, it got about that the house was all that was left to her; and in a way, people were glad. At last they could pity Miss Emily. Being left alone, and a pauper, she had become humanized. Now she too would know the old thrill and the old despair of a penny more or less.

The day after his death all the ladies prepared to call at the house and offer condolence and aid, as is our custom Miss Emily met them at the door, dressed as usual and with no trace of grief on her face. She told them that her father was not dead. She did that for three days, with the ministers calling on her, and the doctors, trying to persuade her to let them dispose of the body. Just as they were about to resort to law and force, she broke down, and they buried her father quickly.

We did not say she was crazy then. We believed she had to do that. We remembered all the young men her father had driven away, and we knew that with nothing left, she would have to cling to that which had robbed her, as people will.

III

SHE WAS SICK for a long time. When we saw her again, her hair was cut short, making her look like a girl, with a vague resemblance to those angels in colored church windows--sort of tragic and serene.

The town had just let the contracts for paving the sidewalks, and in the summer after her father's death they began the work. The construction company came with riggers and mules and machinery, and a foreman named Homer Barron, a Yankee--a big, dark, ready man, with a big voice and eyes lighter than his face. The little boys would follow in groups to hear him cuss the riggers, and the riggers singing in time to the rise and fall of picks. Pretty soon he knew everybody in town. Whenever you heard a lot of laughing anywhere about the square, Homer Barron would be in the center of the group. Presently we began to see him and Miss Emily on Sunday afternoons driving in the yellow-wheeled buggy and the matched team of bays from the livery stable.

At first we were glad that Miss Emily would have an interest, because the ladies all said, ""Of course a Grierson would not think seriously of a Northerner, a day laborer."" But there were still others, older people, who said that even grief could not cause a real lady to forget noblesse oblige- -

Without calling it noblesse oblige. They just said, ""Poor Emily. Her kinsfolk should come to her."" She had some kin in Alabama; but years ago her father had fallen out with them over the estate of old lady Wyatt, the crazy woman, and there was no communication between the two families. They had not even been represented at the funeral.

And as soon as the old people said, ""Poor Emily,"" the whispering began. ""Do you suppose it's really so?"" they said to one another. ""Of course it is. What else could . . ."" This behind their hands; rustling of craned silk and satin behind jalousies closed upon the sun of Sunday afternoon as the thin, swift clop-clop-clop of the matched team passed: ""Poor Emily.""

She carried her head high enough--even when we believed that she was fallen. It was as if she demanded more than ever the recognition of her dignity as the last Grierson; as if it had wanted that touch of earthiness to reaffirm her imperviousness. Like when she bought the rat poison, the arsenic. That was over a year after they had begun to say ""Poor Emily,"" and while the two female cousins were visiting her.
""I want some poison,"" she said to the druggist. She was over thirty then, still a slight woman, though thinner than usual, with cold, haughty black eyes in a face the flesh of which was strained across the temples and about the eyesockets as you imagine a lighthouse-keeper's face ought to look. ""I want some poison,"" she said.

""Yes, Miss Emily. What kind? For rats and such? I'd recom--""

""I want the best you have. I don't care what kind.""



The druggist named several. ""They'll kill anything up to an elephant. But what you want is--""

""Arsenic,"" Miss Emily said. ""Is that a good one?""

""Is . . . arsenic? Yes, ma'am. But what you want--""

""I want arsenic.""

The druggist looked down at her. She looked back at him, erect, her face like a strained flag. ""Why, of course,"" the druggist said. ""If that's what you want. But the law requires you to tell what you are going to use it for.""

Miss Emily just stared at him, her head tilted back in order to look him eye for eye, until he looked away and went and got the arsenic and wrapped it up. The Negro delivery boy brought her the package; the druggist didn't come back. When she opened the package at home there was written on the box, under the skull and bones: ""For rats.""

IV

So THE NEXT day we all said, ""She will kill herself""; and we said it would be the best thing. When she had first begun to be seen with Homer Barron, we had said, ""She will marry him."" Then we said, ""She will persuade him yet,"" because Homer himself had remarked--he liked men, and it was known that he drank with the younger men in the Elks' Club--that he was not a marrying man. Later we said, ""Poor Emily"" behind the jalousies as they passed on Sunday afternoon in the glittering buggy, Miss Emily with her head high and Homer Barron with his hat cocked and a cigar in his teeth, reins and whip in a yellow glove.

Then some of the ladies began to say that it was a disgrace to the town and a bad example to the young people. The men did not want to interfere, but at last the ladies forced the Baptist minister--Miss Emily's people were Episcopal-- to call upon her. He would never divulge what happened during that interview, but he refused to go back again. The next Sunday they again drove about the streets, and the following day the minister's wife wrote to Miss Emily's relations in Alabama.

So she had blood-kin under her roof again and we sat back to watch developments. At first nothing happened. Then we were sure that they were to be married. We learned that Miss Emily had been to the jeweler's and ordered a man's toilet set in silver, with the letters H. B. on each piece. Two days later we learned that she had bought a complete outfit of men's clothing, including a nightshirt, and we said, ""They are married."" We were really glad. We were glad because the two female cousins were even more Grierson than Miss Emily had ever been.

So we were not surprised when Homer Barron--the streets had been finished some time since--was gone. We were a little disappointed that there was not a public blowing-off, but we believed that he had gone on to prepare for Miss Emily's coming, or to give her a chance to get rid of the cousins. (By that time it was a cabal, and we were all Miss Emily's allies to help circumvent the cousins.) Sure enough, after another week they departed. And, as we had expected all along, within three days Homer Barron was back in town. A neighbor saw the Negro man admit him at the kitchen door at dusk one evening.

And that was the last we saw of Homer Barron. And of Miss Emily for some time. The Negro man went in and out with the market basket, but the front door remained closed. Now and then we would see her at a window for a moment, as the men did that night when they sprinkled the lime, but for almost six months she did not appear on the streets. Then we knew that this was to be expected too; as if that quality of her father which had thwarted her woman's life so many times had been too virulent and too furious to die.

When we next saw Miss Emily, she had grown fat and her hair was turning gray. During the next few years it grew grayer and grayer until it attained an even pepper-and-salt iron-gray, when it ceased turning. Up to the day of her death at seventy-four it was still that vigorous iron-gray, like the hair of an active man.

From that time on her front door remained closed, save for a period of six or seven years, when she was about forty, during which she gave lessons in china-painting. She fitted up a studio in one of the downstairs rooms, where the daughters and granddaughters of Colonel Sartoris' contemporaries were sent to her with the same regularity and in the same spirit that they were sent to church on Sundays with a twenty-five-cent piece for the collection plate. Meanwhile her taxes had been remitted.

Then the newer generation became the backbone and the spirit of the town, and the painting pupils grew up and fell away and did not send their children to her with boxes of color and tedious brushes and pictures cut from the ladies' magazines. The front door closed upon the last one and remained closed for good. When the town got free postal delivery, Miss Emily alone refused to let them fasten the metal numbers above her door and attach a mailbox to it. She would not listen to them.

Daily, monthly, yearly we watched the Negro grow grayer and more stooped, going in and out with the market basket. Each December we sent her a tax notice, which would be returned by the post office a week later, unclaimed. Now and then we would see her in one of the downstairs windows--she had evidently shut up the top floor of the house--like the carven torso of an idol in a niche, looking or not looking at us, we could never tell which. Thus she passed from generation to generation--dear, inescapable, impervious, tranquil, and perverse.

And so she died. Fell ill in the house filled with dust and shadows, with only a doddering Negro man to wait on her. We did not even know she was sick; we had long since given up trying to get any information from the Negro

He talked to no one, probably not even to her, for his voice had grown harsh and rusty, as if from disuse.

She died in one of the downstairs rooms, in a heavy walnut bed with a curtain, her gray head propped on a pillow yellow and moldy with age and lack of sunlight.

V

THE NEGRO met the first of the ladies at the front door and let them in, with their hushed, sibilant voices and their quick, curious glances, and then he disappeared. He walked right through the house and out the back and was not seen again.

The two female cousins came at once. They held the funeral on the second day, with the town coming to look at Miss Emily beneath a mass of bought flowers, with the crayon face of her father musing profoundly above the bier and the ladies sibilant and macabre; and the very old men --some in their brushed Confederate uniforms--on the porch and the lawn, talking of Miss Emily as if she had been a contemporary of theirs, believing that they had danced with her and courted her perhaps, confusing time with its mathematical progression, as the old do, to whom all the past is not a diminishing road but, instead, a huge meadow which no winter ever quite touches, divided from them now by the narrow bottle-neck of the most recent decade of years.

Already we knew that there was one room in that region above stairs which no one had seen in forty years, and which would have to be forced. They waited until Miss Emily was decently in the ground before they opened it.

The violence of breaking down the door seemed to fill this room with pervading dust. A thin, acrid pall as of the tomb seemed to lie everywhere upon this room decked and furnished as for a bridal: upon the valance curtains of faded rose color, upon the rose-shaded lights, upon the dressing table, upon the delicate array of crystal and the man's toilet things backed with tarnished silver, silver so tarnished that the monogram was obscured. Among them lay a collar and tie, as if they had just been removed, which, lifted, left upon the surface a pale crescent in the dust. Upon a chair hung the suit, carefully folded; beneath it the two mute shoes and the discarded socks.

The man himself lay in the bed.

For a long while we just stood there, looking down at the profound and fleshless grin. The body had apparently once lain in the attitude of an embrace, but now the long sleep that outlasts love, that conquers even the grimace of love, had cuckolded him. What was left of him, rotted beneath what was left of the nightshirt, had become inextricable from the bed in which he lay; and upon him and upon the pillow beside him lay that even coating of the patient and biding dust.

Then we noticed that in the second pillow was the indentation of a head. One of us lifted something from it, and leaning forward, that faint and invisible dust dry and acrid in the nostrils, we saw a long strand of iron-gray hair.",302466,en,en,en

Running in the alley I can hear them dogs barkin'
And my brothers ain't been robbin', all they do is scam banks

Tumblin' on this mental hill and I don't have a sled
Slipping on this ice

[Verse 2: Rico] I am my own inspiration, cause I’m always on the mic I’m never takin a vacation, then I’d rewrite and listen to what I’m sayin, and that made me believe that this will be my vocation, man face it, you’ll never put me down while I’m racing, to the top of my game and first place on the podium’s what I’m takin, so I keep making, then people try to imitate and take it back to their playground times, they try to emulate a sound that’s mine, so I have to regulate their minds, rule is that they should meditate and reflect on their lives, and contemplate their decision of tryna steal my vibes, but hey copying is the best form of flattery, least that’s what they say to me it’s a crime and worse than battery, so while y’all do it and make nothing I’ll be over here living lavishly, while my Gs and I are laughing at that tragedy, cause it’s sad to me, that while y’all rap about random ass stuff I’m just keeping it real, and that produces the music that people feel, so I guess the rap game is mine to steal, and I wouldn’t even need a deal, I swear in 5 years imma be watching the highlight reel, but Rico at what cost, how many friends will you have lost, will your heart be hit by Jack Frost, or are you gonna become soft, man imma never change, imma forever stay strange, and as long as I’m in range, the ball is going in the hoop, I’m too good and I’m in the loop, hell I think it might be time to start a group, but Rico what if you fail, get locked in jail, or after one project your career gets derailed, and other styles come in and erase all your trails, you know forget it cut this beat off I don’t deserve it, psych I’m ready to take this burden, cause they acknowledge skill and they’ve heard it, it took a while to learn it, but now Imma live off preaching my sermon
[Chorus: Rico] So I’ll spit a bunch of brag raps than y’all ain’t on, I’ll spit bangers and introspective tracks so long, I’ll spit reminiscent tracks and tell stories, but when I spit I’ll get it but I’m not in it for the glory, I don’t spit to see money and cameras flashing, I spit cause this is it and this my passion",3809682,en,en,en

Cold fire, you've got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace child

It can all but break your heart
In pieces

Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes

He said, ""I've been where you've been before
Down every hallway's a slamming door""
No way out, no one to come and save me
Wasting a life that the Good Lord gave me

Then somebody said what I'm saying to you
Opened my eyes and told me the truth
They said, ""Just a little faith, it'll all get better""

Didn't think about it for a couple of days
And I felt love pouring down from above

Changed
And now I'm stronger

There must be something in the water

Can't nobody wipe this smile off my face
Trust in someone bigger than me

Im chill as chilly willy 'cept my wings ain't vestigle

This is justin bieber and don cheadle
Not the picture of dorian or the color of delorean
This mr. popper's floppy penguin emporium
As polarly opposite as europe and california

This ain't the
Dramatic anatomy version of scrubs
Im as sick and absorbant as a sponge covered in suds
Like slow down bud, an introduction i need none
So let me grab the mic  and demonstrate the way it's done

I leave rappers going green like i was Gaiwan the green
Spitting masterpieces you're all screaming leedle leedle lee
I'm the leader of this team, you're sitting bench on little league
Call me Pee-Wee cause I'm coming in your local theater screen
Im in it to win it no kiddin dont gimme an intro duction
I spit on your bottom you stick to a window you're into suction
My ego has macromastia i need a reduction
You cats sit back while this CAT raises destruction

I feel all you divas
Should listen to mat cause
I viva la vida
You viva viagra


You whack a mole cracker
Mommy packin lunch for class and
I'll be stackin bills
You're eating a sandwhich with jelly and smelly molasses
Im asking a question its simple just answer and i will leave you at the spot
Just let me come down for a second i really can't hear you from sittin on top

Do i need to teach you to steal from a detective
So that you can learn to take a hint you little limped defective
Wreck im made of steel i said, your raps are not very effective
And it doesn't help your cause that I eat fairies for breakfast  -beat cuts off-

While I'm pillaging your village like the Khan
You're getting action like the men who go to nail salons
Just quit all the hissy fit pissin dont have a conniption im making you stutter
Cause ""his flow so smooth you can't believe it ain't butter""
You fruit, you've got less flow than hair on men who have to wear a toupee
You just a groupay im a bigger fiasco than lupe

I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me?
Well it's been a year
It doesn't surprise me
[Happy Christmas]
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ""I love you""
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
My god I thought you were
Someone to rely on
Me ?
I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year

Get Out,rap,Scarub,2014,256,{},"Want For Nothing...

[VERSE 1]
Curb side service, drop and go, no luggage checked
Carry on earth's surface, got a stroll like I own this shit
I savvy travel, skid-addle, dabble a bit, then scramble
Sally forward through allies, catty-corners, and tunnels
Breaching zones, I reach and roam what's shown when TV's on
A beast that feast upon, beats he's thrown, then speaks in poems
Ease along the streets, my karma's peace, I'm on some reap what's sewn
To each his own, performing songs with heat that leaves the speakers blown
Another day at work, and yet I'm taking off
A model citizen, that runway's my catwalk

Front of the plan like a fighter pilot riding high
Over head weather clear or cloudy, I be
Mileage compiling while gliding to islands
Sky is the limit, I'm frequently flying

Test drive a plan, joy ride a jet
Passing through, what's popping, nice to drop in, just pit stopping
City swapping often, like bar hopping, watch me screech on down your block and
It ain't a option, Carpe Diem till I want for nothing
Spinning the globe on the trigger finger, figure
Get up and go, and adventure out the window
When on the road pure ascension, watch a winner
Balling or broke, new dimensions I will enter
Stamps all over the passport, looking like a Nascar
Orbiting the maps far reaches
Surfing on sofas and couches in foreign hang-outs
Crashing house parties on beaches

No bikini lines, that's the naked truth
Or martini lines, a selected few, somewhere out recluse
No ceilings or blinds, heaven is our roof, or meaning of time
No such thing as rules, No this ain't taught in schools

Life is a journey and I am in root of it
Intuitive movement for lucrative proceeds to propel my purpose for doing shit
Ingenuitive, just passing through, don't trip, the world is turning, now what you gone do with it?
Stroller to gurney, from cradle to grave yard shift
Me, I fool with it, break all the rules and dip
I just cruz and get in where I choose to fit

[VERSE 2]
Over oceans flying, coast to coast, I'm island skipping
I'm just gliding far and wide and riding by on a jet engine
Life's ambitions, so addicting, sky high, great heights I'm hitting when
Blood, sweat and tears pays off when I collect and cash in them checks
My balance like yoga pimping, hold my position, feel upliftment
When reaching for the sun, moon, and stars, enjoy the stretch
Over and out of your area, way out of reach, I'm in flight breaking barriers
Made bounds and leaps through a mic and a stereo
Hustle for keeps, on the grind till they bury me, got these...

Gears turning, spinning wheels within wheels
Midnight oil burning, working, birth ideas and then build them
Invent, envisions, of me living, sprawled out where I please
Wanting for nothing but the finer things for me and my children

Work on the move, on a mission for loot, vagabond breaking through
Grab the cash and vamoose
Nothing to prove, I'm just dashing en route, with a plan to re-coup
All the time I been doing this
In lieu of just working in cubicles, choosing whats suitable, jerked in a cruel abyss
My solution, to spit with a truth and roll, far as the future go
All while pursuing bliss

Gotta master fire first, before you forge steel
Gotta make the tools, that make the tools, before you make the wheel
Gotta like these simpletons, before you get my spiel
Hate me now, thank me later player, eventually yo will

Live in he future right out of a dream
And I hustle, maneuver like I was a fiend
Working the circuit for beans
Circle the earth on a search for the finer of things
Itching and money's like calamine cream
Ain't no fiction, I'm hungry and journey for green
While I'm under the radar my hustle unseen, on the run for the paper
Want for nothing",533761,en,en,en

I'm aiming for something more, I'm not trying to be diminished
Giving it my all, nothing less than the full percentage

One day, I'm gonna eat until I'm full
I'm gonna keep pushing like a door that you don't know that you should pull
Manoeuvring through the valleys, and climbing over the mountains
Ignoring all of these niggas who only about the doubting
Same goal, it's just a different location
You gotta know what you're about
You gotta know where you're stationed
I keep moving to the goal, that's an ambitious migration
And I don't ever take a pause like it was poor punctuation
Sometimes it's gonna get much rougher than sandpaper
And the pressure building up like the biggest of skyscrapers
But I promise you, I am an honest dude, I'm going make it through
You know it's always real, never fake it, ooh

This journey is so taxing, I swear that much is required
Trophies on my dresser, past goals I've acquired
Now I try to keep it solid, while I'm steady spitting fire
Sometimes I'm breaking down, but these niggas ain't even know it
Most times, people only see it when it show it
Ain't no Hercules, it's hard to stay strong
Nothing good to say? Keep it going, move along
Grateful to the people, who have always got my back
I could stack up all the cash, but there is no repaying that
And I honestly know that I'm moving so very distant
Got some stuff up in my life, that keeps needing some fixing
But we keep pressing like an iron to a shirt
I will never ever stop until they put me in the dirt
Till the casket drop, till my coffin's closed

Walking wounded, head hanging down, running like a thief

But even when you're running blind you are still not lost, my friend
Oh, you can run, but you never can hide

Whoa, love will find you again

You can shake your angry fist at the sky, but it'll roll right over you
A force of nature that won't be denied, no matter what you do

And even when you heart's so scarred that you swear it cannot mend
Oh, where you stand, right where you are
Love will find you again

You can damn it all to hell: the shattered dreams and the world as well
It's hard to see through tears-stained eyes how the pain could ever end
Oh, but life's a mystery and a surprise

From Ralph Waldo Emersons Nature - 6th Hr,misc,JakeAThomas,2015,19,"{""Ralph Waldo Emerson""}","Nature is a setting that fits equally well a comic or a mourning piece. In good health, the air is a cordial of incredible virtue. Crossing a bare common, in snow puddles, at twilight, under a clouded sky, without having in my thoughts any occurrence of special good fortune, I have enjoyed a perfect exhilaration. I am glad to the brink of fear. In the woods too, a man casts off his years, as the snake his slough, and at what period soever of life, is always a child. In the woods, is perpetual youth. Within these plantations of God, a decorum and sanctity reign, a perennial festival is dressed, and the guest sees not how he should tire of them in a thousand years. In the woods, we return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing can befall me in life, — no disgrace, no calamity, (leaving me my eyes,) which nature cannot repair. Standing on the bare ground, — my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space, — all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or particle of God. The name of the nearest friend sounds then foreign and accidental: to be brothers, to be acquaintances, — master or servant, is then a trifle and a disturbance. I am the lover of uncontained and immortal beauty. In the wilderness, I find something more dear and connate than in streets or villages. In the tranquil landscape, and especially in the distant line of the horizon, man beholds somewhat as beautiful as his own nature.

The greatest delight which the fields and woods minister, is the suggestion of an occult relation between man and the vegetable. I am not alone and unacknowledged. They nod to me, and I to them. The waving of the boughs in the storm, is new to me and old. It takes me by surprise, and yet is not unknown. Its effect is like that of a higher thought or a better emotion coming over me, when I deemed I was thinking justly or doing right.

Yet it is certain that the power to produce this delight, does not reside in nature, but in man, or in a harmony of both. It is necessary to use these pleasures with great temperance. For, nature is not always tricked in holiday attire, but the same scene which yesterday breathed perfume and glittered as for the frolic of the nymphs, is overspread with melancholy today. Nature always wears the colors of the spirit. To a man laboring under calamity, the heat of his own fire hath sadness in it. Then, there is a kind of contempt of the landscape felt by him who has just lost by death a dear friend. The sky is less grand as it shuts down over less worth in the population.",689960,en,en,en

Persistent like the rasps at chains of the world

Into perpetual dementia the crossroads twirl
Here at the eye of the storm
But from an unusual tree my cane was cut
And it is ever by my side

Wherever leads the trail
Whatever burden that oppress the heart
Where sorrows thrive
And shadows linger everlasting
On vacant thrones

Behold a river aflow
Winding and twisting, back to its source
There goes our way
Through everlasting decay
To where the Temple stands eternally
Ours is a path of power
Edged by the remmants of the slain
Long have we walked upon it
But ours is the patience of the pilgrim
Who journeys against the tide
Ever towards the Sanctuary
Beyond the shores of life and Death

For it has made me a defier of every law
That robs my kind of liberty and grace
I am he that move in the valleys of the damned
And none shall lessen my pace

Besieged, expired and undone
The waste, from whence I am gone

Behold the last of stars ascend
To mark the return
To the night without end

To where, the Temple stands eternally

In scars that ever bleed

Such a nervous wreck, my legs are shaking
Too much pasta last night, my stomach’s quaking
Getting top 5, hope that’s my ranking
Know it’s real cold, but my spirit ain’t breaking
My teammate on the bus, he was getting cocky
Back at DCLs, he was really rocky
Don’t know why he thinks he’s top on the team
Heard he’s skipping track and going straight to hockey
Back at Franklin, there was a big hill
Saw my friend fall, yeah he took a big spill
Getting back up, what a strong will
At the end when he finished, it was such a thrill

Went and passed him, I finished fourth place

Check the merch tent, see what we can buy
Charging fifty for a shirt, now that's a real crime

I don't cheat on my woman
There's no adultery in my heart
So this song might not be sordid enough
To get it on the country charts
Now, clean living might not sell records
But I ain't looking for any fans
When I say I love my darling wife
And I'm a happily married man

[Verse 2]
Now, if I had a lover waiting in every town
I'd have enough songs for an album or two
Telling how I fooled around
But I can't write about a two-timing life
Like some of them superstars can
I may not have a hit, but in spite of it
I'm a happily married man

[Chorus]
Happily married man
Signed, sealed and faithful
From the beginning, that's the way the Good Lord had it planned
And when it comes to being hitched
I'd rather fight than switch
That is why I'm taking a happily married stand
Play it, Jerry, rock and roll!

[Guitar Solo]

You never could play it country

[Verse 3]
Now listen
Now divorce has gone big business
To fool around is really in
People dress it up and call 'em love affairs
When God just calls it sin
What they need is the Good Lord's guidance
The foundation of his mighty hand
To bind a happily married woman
To a happily married man

[Chorus]
Happily married man
Signed, sealed and faithful
From the beginning, that's the way the Good Lord had it planned
And when it comes to being hitched

Like babies they lie
The wombs they blest once
Not healed dry
And yet - too soon
Into each space
A cold earth falls
On colder face.
Quite still they lie

Clutched in earth

But they will not bloom
When called by spring
To burst with leaf
And blossoming
They sleep on
In silent dust
As crosses rot

Hacker Wars V2.0,rap,YTCracker,2017,852,{},"We run the gamut - freedom fighters, griefers, bandits
Hackers, spammers, phreakers gambit just how far back they can ram it
Some do damage from the pulpit claim they lead and they're the culprit
Others do it from the shadows switching handles when convenient secret treatment
Question our agenda, troll or internet defender?
Tango down, a packet sender going on a DDoS bender
Who intend to take a stand drawing lines in the sand
In them silicon wafers and them fiberoptic cables

Trace enabled pick a side - more than two no black and white
Shades of gray its more like 50 kinky gifted play the system swiftly
Moving in and out and under groups to keep it undercover
Governments then wonder how to follow em like thunder
So agents of the state coordinate attacks against their own
And other teams compete against each other trying to take the throne
Motivations differ so the victory conditions shift
Battleground: the internet - fighting with our fingertips

Hacker wars - conflicting over broadband and data stores (hacker wars)

Old spaghetti Western good bad ugly pick your poison
And each one makes their noise in different ways so let them boys in
Every system every outlet every avenue of avarice
The mavericks of information face off with the candidates
And cameras are there to document the struggle live in person
Take a peek behind the curtain situations worse than
Anything the casuals and NPCs could dream of
'cause this team of brilliant bastards go on tearing the whole scene up

Journalists in media don't buy what they are feeding ya
Depleting ya of truth because of influential groups
They don't wanna lose their access so they don't care what the facts is
Let alone reporting pieces they don't preach nor do they practice
Let the hackers be the source of breaking news by breaking in
To every system every outlet let me say it once again
So those hackers with the badges keep their jobs and stay employed

To make my mark upon the earth

He calls me Charlie Mason
A stargazer am I

To chart the evening sky
They'd cut me out for baking bread
But I had other dreams instead
This baker's boy from the west country
Would join the Royal Society

You talk of liberty
How can America be free
A Geordie and a baker's boy
In the forests of the Iroquois

Now hold your head up, Mason
See America lies there

The capes of Delaware
Come up and feel the sun

And so, lost in his thoughts
Of all the ammunition used in the war he's fought
With weapons of words, he can't undo
He tried so hard, just to be cool

But things were said, and promises made
When it comes to emotions it's never a game
But this isn't like anything that's happened before
No, this time, this is something more

[Chorus]
A conquest started, a whole war lost
It seems like nothing, but what's the cost?
To think some rivalry caused a bitter end
And this is how, to lose a friend

[Verse 2]
Anger in the purest form
And hatred sticking into the heart, like a thorn
Or a twisted knife, you can't pull out
No amount of ""sorry's"" can reverse that now
But things were great, before we started to tear
Now the future's only promise is up in the air
Feelings trailing after like a menacing cloud
Of everything you regret when your mind wasn't sound

[Chorus]
A conquest started, a whole war lost
It seems like nothing, but what's the cost?
To think some rivalry caused a bitter end
And this is how, to lose a friend

[End]
You know if I could, I'd do it all again
I'd never say those terrible things that I said to you
Then I wouldn't be in this mess
Of words spewed in anger, but I must confess

That a conquest was started, but the war was lost
It seems like nothing now, but think of the cost
Now look what's happened, what's met its' end

Deep beneath my skin
I felt the change of pace as all the walls began to spin
I said I wasn't sure
There's a lot I never say, 'cause it just gets in the way of me
And any bit of work that I might have found myself to gain
Deceased

Switched up, don't wait up

Kept loosely tied
I'm looking for what I can't find
Even though it's hung in front of my eyes this long
'Cause I'm too busy looking in the places that I'll never belong
Dead wrong
Losing out on the win, 'cause I've been headstrong

I give weedheads the munchees
Crackheads a bum knee

Need a diet of
Steamed leafy greens

Of solid beats
And hot spicy bars of words

Spittin slurs

Cut off your hands
Cause your mans lookin shifty
Fuck up your plans

I knock her boots
Then get ghost like patrick swayze
With clay, moldin my verse in her hands

Live to wreck another day

That I should do him in this time
And I could find a better life
Become a burden on the state

And I realized that I repeat myself
Well I woke up this morning

They say one and one is two
Well I have my suspicions
I believe it may well be another one of these
Crazy old religious superstitions
Would you believe the same financial institution
Backing both sides of every war
Since before the French Revolution
Still run the Federal Reserve?
In all but just a small handful of nations
It's a paper clip operation
By even the most reasonable explanation
It may well be the single longest whitest Bronco chase
In the history of the conspiracy of television is all I'm sayin'

Sellin' perpetual murder and mass destruction
Under the false flag of my protection
From the shadow branch of a government
Still under the spell of its own addiction
To untold commercialization

Why it would seem easy to me to see
Without too much hesitation
How someone could just
Wake up one morning
And come to the Richard Lewis-like conclusion and/or realization
That there was absolutely no hope whatsoever left
For even the slightest portion of our entire civilization

So zippity-doodah motherfucker
Zippity-ayy
My, oh my, what a wonderful case of the blues
I am experiencing today
While the air in my motel has been conditioned
In just such a way
That it seems like every single note
I ask this priceless banjo of mine to play
Takes the unmistakeable sounds of my depths and my pains and my sorrow
And turns 'em into some kind of embarrasin' soundin' hope for tomorrow
And that's not me, man
That's not who I am

[Verse 5]
You know, we mistake desperate people for the devil all the time
So there is no real way of knowing
What kind of a deal it was that I actually signed
But it was my understanding
That I would be the single greatest blues guitar player in the world by now, and I am not
In fact, to the contrary
I'm just another workin' fuckin' schmuck out here standin' around waiting to get shot
In yet another tragic edition
To an already sorry state of affairs
With yet another set of politicians
Takin' to the top of another set of courthouse stairs

You know you are out of ideas
When you get down to your thoughts and your prayers
But that's just what they're doin' down here
On these courthouse stairs

Yeah, posing for pictures on the carper with Gucci tuxedos
Funny how my life changed, they called me a zero
Taking hella vodka shots, she sipping on pinot
Fast forward stardawg still killing my people
Fendi or Louis, it's really tomato omata
Portugal for 3 weeks, I'm taking the shottas
African Prince, I'm flying with peregrine wings
Writing a cheque, I sign it with feather and ink
Clutching a tech I'm praying it never will sing
Bought me a yard, I met her I gave her an inch
Only God can change me or maybe Allah
On my good and worst days I reason wid Jah

[Chorus: Chronixx]
I and I and Rastafari hold a reasoning
Jah tell mi 'son this is your season
Never let them drain this energy

His image I came in, fuck what they tell you later
We gone push and shove and it's still love
Brother, I'm still a monk, you is amongst
I got a daughter, I'm ready, I need a son
I buried my brother young, you'll never know when it comes
I reason it with my mum and those before I come
Alakazam, I park a 'Rari on my land
My latest nephew was born with one hand
You dribble with what you can, guide on how to be a man, uh
I give you mine one love, one light, one shine
They can erase your name, but not what's inside ya
Too much focus on pounds, let's look in to Naira's
Invent in our colour forever we diamonds

What kinda law would make it so hard for a singer to keep his art?
And still make a fortune and not just a couple cars
I'm talkin' about 50 thousand acres with some rivers and minerals
I'm in a call with architects
Designing a house in and out now call a jet
Fly down to the south, write a song at Treasure Beach
Next day we go record at Falmouth
Living up no wan fi hear no man mouth only one fi

Approaching me with likkle bit of dough for we songs

From the moment we met, I was breathless
And not asbestos breathless either
Always, when you least expect it
Stumbled across Rapunzel, a Libra
Couldn't leave, I had to meet her
Greet the girl of my dreams with a kiss on the hand (What up?)
Little magnificent, missin' a man
Ran away like kids to adventure
Gorgeous, walkin' on water
Sort of like Erin McNaught, but little shorter
Wore a Pandora, bought her a charm
Wasn't short of a thought, bit of Paul on her arm
Callin' for calm, we fought
Made Iraq and the border of Jordan, a walk in the park
Jaws of a shark, too hard to break it off
Fall apart, so I would say

Rapunzel, gotta let your hair down
Girl, gotta let your hair down
I'm tired of fightin'
We ain't going nowhere now
Gotta let your hair down
Girl, gotta let your hair down

We ain't goin' nowhere now

And even she could see, her love was like a demolition derby
I was Herbie the love bug, swervin'
'Cause I work on the road
She was like Russell the Crowe, a jerk with her phone!
Know that I don't wanna fight
Another night, chewin' off my ear like Mike
Another night ruined, I knew it, knew you would do it
Scream when I'm out like Hewitt
You were the one, you were the one to run away
Like andale, andale then break it off, but come runnin' back
Like, ""Baby, I want you back, but don't call me that""
Now baby, baby, baby, don't call me ""baby"", baby

Don't you love me anymore?

Nah, I'm just sick of you sayin' my friends are above you
You knew when you were with me
But you were lost in watchin' Sex and the City
And what did you give me?
Your lips movin' but nothin' comin' out, like Britney
And, what, did you lose it?
No trust, every movement watched like Truman
Only human, I ain't a saint
But don't cheat when I'm in the game
And that's real, you know, you know
No, you know you don't know me
Die from the photos I got, like Dodi
My own Naomi Campbell
I tried to help, she fly off the handle
No more candles, no more dinner
No more ""I'm fat, I could look a little thinner""

And keep my mind clear of poisonous stunts and beams

The robe of sin
Spewing deceit
With every sermon

Slaves at every corner
Begging for forgiveness
Waiting to be led
To the promised land

Is the beacon of hope to most
The choice you had is no longer your own

I know this may come as
A surprise to you

You ain't fucking me up on the first day
And I could give a fuck if its your birthday

Mama always told me have manners
And if you ain't a naughty girl maybe you'll meet Santa
Even though I'm independent never needed no Santa
I drop my panties on the first day, bitch where's my manners ?
I met a young nigga ,man he was spitting good game
He had a gold mind on him even carried some fame
Walk up on me like ""damn you gotta ass, what's your name?""
Not can I take you out, come to my crib I wanna hang
See in my mind I'm thinking he thinking that I'm the one
But in his mind he thinking young, dumb, and full of cum
Get to this nigga house and ain't nobody fuckin here
He introduced me to his room like can't wait to fuck you here
I'm thinking, sex young nigga? I only knew you for six hours
I'm like ""lets watch a movie fo' this day turn sour""

Wait he did text he said ""how you like the dick?""
In my fucking head I'm frustrated as shit

Notch Sold The Game (Why?)

(Verse 1) (Steve Blockz)
I remember when I used to frick with Alex
I don't do that no more
Nowadays, I have a diamond palace
And of course, diamond floors
Alex used to mine them for me, we used to be so close
Guess both of us just lost hope
But we don't need each other no more
We needed each other before
But that was back in alpha, before Alex became a builder
And I became a miner, and I know the ores thrilled her
But we ain't a thang nowadays
We just play the game different ways

(Chorus) (Wolfadvice)
I remember the old days, back before the Dragon
When me and Alex wanted to do stuff you couldn't imagine
But then the time came, and we parted ways
I don't even think we talked to each other on that last day
I was a miner, living in the caves
I was a miner, I needed haste
Alex was a builder, she needed blocks
I remember when I used to want Alex to build me a place
Alex never cared about diamond socks, or diamond versace
I was a miner, living in the caves
I was a miner, I needed haste
I remember when I used to want Alex to build me a place
Alex was a builder, she needed blocks
Alex never cared about diamond socks, or diamond versace
(Verse 2) (Steve Blockz)
People drift apart if they ain't lovin'
Me and Alex went from somethin' to nothin'
I used to think we would be together, forever
I used to think we wouldn't part ways, never
No, this ain't a ""Lucid Dreams"" parody
Me and Alex just wanted clarity
Childhood dreams just weren't enough
We used to be kids who treasured ores like toys from Toys-R-Us
In the end, we didn't want to accomplish the same thing
Alex wanted to build, I wanted to be the mineshaft king
I wanted to explore, Alex wanted to build a town
And after that, we never came around

(Chorus) (Wolfadvice)
I remember the old days, back before the Dragon
When me and Alex wanted to do stuff you couldn't imagine
But then the time came, and we parted ways
I don't even think we talked to each other on that last day
I was a miner, living in the caves
I was a miner, I needed haste
Alex was a builder, she needed blocks
Alex never cared about diamond socks, or diamond versace
I remember when I used to want Alex to build me a place
I was a miner, living in the caves
I was a miner, I needed haste
I remember when I used to want Alex to build me a place
Alex was a builder, she needed blocks
Alex never cared about diamond socks, or diamond versace
(Verse 3) (Steve Blockz)
Me and Alex don't see eye to eye no more
We always did before
Nowadays, we have our own interests
And we did wish each other the best
But nowadays, we're not upset
We now think it was right
For me to turn right, and Alex to turn left
I still sometimes hear about her
About the new town, and how she's the founder
And she stills hears about me
How now in the caves, I'm the king

(Interlude) (TorontoFortnite)
Ooh

(Chorus) (Wolfadvice)
I remember the old days, back before the Dragon
When me and Alex wanted to do stuff you couldn't imagine

Alex never cared about diamond socks, or diamond versace
(Verse 4) (TheEveryBlockMiner)
Used to spit fast raps for my girl
But nowadays, we play in different worlds
And are in our own worlds
We ain't what we used to be
She was getting used to me
We wanted to be the future thing
But no more, we went our own direction
And yet today, we still feel affection
I don't regret us parting
I personally think it was the smart thing
As we got older, we realized our goal in life
And what we wanted to do all the time
She wanted to build, I wanted to mine
She wanted blocks, I wanted ores 'cause they so fine
We realized things are different, and we listened
And to this day, her I'm still missin'
But we realized that's what we were missin'
We weren't the same, not from the start
But soon Alex wanted the light, and I wanted the dark
And then we were apart
She's in a grand town, I'm in the cave in my minecart
One day, I walked out the mine
And I saw the town that she built
And now I can see it ain't having trouble breathing
I looked at her, and she caught my eye
And I can see we still ain't speaking
But for a while, our differences were what we weren't seeing

(Outro) Steve, (Alex)
(It's time)
Yeah, I know
(We're fine)
I know where I wanna go
(You got everything)
Everything, time to go

Hey, that's fine. We have different goals

There's gonna be a lotta white kids rollin with the Africans

Cause there'll be a lot of blacks is down with the Republicans

Trying to extract
Emotions written on my face

My days in my hands
Same predicament as yesterday

That's how I start my day
I wasn't fazed
Clouds to comfort my lay
I was a blank page
What's the move Sayii?
My nigga Chris asked everyday
Vintage Stater for the starter
Had no money to get the car up
Just trying to get paid
Nothing was overlaid I say Ole
Niggas ducking out the way
Picked up my date twenty minutes late
Night shift was a pain
I just did my thang
""I am on the way""
Making my way
Day-less days

[Chorus]
In my days what a waste
Nothing according to plan
I had blues in my backyard
I was sitting on top of my roof
Weed in my lungs
A feeling like nothing to lose
Texting a girl that was minor distract
Life was abstract
Trying to extract
Emotions written on my face
A Fifteenth year old where do I go?
Parking lot rain, don't mind if it's cold
I felt the kisses of doves
Summer blissful to the hands
My days in my hands
Same predicament as yesterday
I wonder what will change?
Another waste of a day
My girl to comfort my lay
Day-less Days
[Verse 2]
In an environment to pull my pants up and say what's up?
High school was just to square up
The future and past luck
I could never touch
The sky beyond the limit
Don't test my limit
Killing me more and more I wanted more
Do you even have
What I'm looking for?
Waiting for the day
What's time in a day?
Pushing for answers
Just trying to relate
Money what I'm trying make
Weed blowing to the face
Just wanted escape the future and past
The blend between the two, the grey zone
It happened so fast
The thought of the two gave me a rash
Day dreaming in class
Writing all my raps
Thinking I have to wrap
Emotions
Weakness
Being conceded
I had a mission
Run everything that's living
Smoking some weed thinking I was living
High on my girl
I was truly missing
Take me back to roof tops
Girls going crazy of SAPS
Nigga just trying to take a nap
Lunch room fights breaking out
Fifteenth year old
Where do I go?
Day-less days
[Chorus]
In my days what a waste
Nothing according to plan
I had blues in my backyard
I was sitting on top of my roof
Weed in my lungs
A feeling like nothing to lose
Texting a girl that was minor distract

Trying to extract
Emotions written on my face
A Fifteenth year old where do I go?
Parking lot rain, don't mind if it's cold

I'm just savouring familiar sights
We share some history
This town and I
And I can't stop that long forgotten feeling of him
Time to book a room and stay tonight

Number one is to find some friends to say
""You're doing well
After all this time
You boys look just the same""

Number two is the happy hour at one of two hotels
Settle in to play
""Do you remember so and so? ""
Number three is never say her name

Oh, the flame trees will blind the weary driver
And there's nothing else could set fire to this town
There's no change
There's no pace
Everything within its place
Just makes it harder to believe that she won't be around
Oh, who needs that sentimental bullshit, anyway
You know it takes more than just a memory to make me cry
And I'm happy just to sit here
Round a table with old friends
And see which one of us can tell the biggest lies

And there's a girl
She's falling in love near where the pianola stands
With a young local factory out-of-worker
Just holding hands
And I'm wondering if he'll go or if he'll stay

Do you remember
Nothing stopped us on the field
In our day

Oh, the flame trees will blind the weary driver
And there's nothing else could set fire to this town
There's no change
There's no pace
Everything within its place
Just makes it harder to believe that she won't be around

Got these bitches hatin' on you, but it don't offend you
You my number one, just know that you got no contenders
You keep that pussy so clean when I be goin' in
I'd spend my life in your box, don't need no codefendant
Go 'head, cut these niggas off like they have no existence
They can't go the distance, I'm oh-for-oh for instance
Fuck the gym, let me pull up and give that stroke of fitness
She a five-star shawty, still down to go for Denny's
Down to go for Wendy's
McDonald's chicken fries, thickest thighs
Seen it in her eyes, shawty know I know I seen her
Netflix and chill, and we can go to dinner
My schedule busy, but for you, girl, I'll make no agenda
You got no contenders
You kept it hot for me all in my cold Decembers
No pretendin'

Room spinnin', I don't know
Unzip my pants and get to blowin', you so nasty
Then what's up with me?
You stayed up tonight to fuck with me
Mmh, lucky me
Gucci panties, sit that pussy on some double G's
Fifty pairs of those'll only cost a couple G's, yeah
Just give me something to work with
Something with purpose
First time that we fucked, girl, you was nervous

Been milkin' the game since I was breastfed
Long enough to know that women with lisps give the best head
But not with braces
Your pussy talking's the only conversation, yap, yap
Grab her hair, pull her track back
Got somethin' to prove
Not from Houston but I got somethin' to screw at all times
She said it's all mine
All dimes, y'all fuck with nickels
I be in them guts, pokin' them sides until it tickles
Squeeze the Charmin on her soft ass
No, I don't pay 'em to come, I pay 'em to go, ho
No credit, all cash (Ching)
Be slidin' up and use a worthful transaction
And then just hop up off my dick with no attachments

Never fold up under pressure, gotta play it smart
Sticking to the script is the easy way to play your part

Bought a nice diamond chain just in case the days get dark
Car notes and insurance use to eat my check
And now I leave business meetings with financial respect
She was shy when I met her, I got her so comfortable
She think the sex is great and it makes her so loveable
After sex we layed up watching wayans brothers
For the first child that I have, she wanna be the mother
I sell her dreams cause I really think otherwise
Deep down girl, I'm just a player in disguise

Or is it that because yo ass ain't got no bills to pay
Im always around the way when I'm far away
Im coming back to where the love is, I don't tend to stay

But my advice to her, it shol won't work
She ain't looking for no words of encouragement
Regardless of the fact, I give her all the mental nourishment

I'm too legit, stay low and duck the cops
I only work with niggas who stay committed

What do I say when you ask me what I'm thinking 'bout
No I'm not part of the crowd, I'm just passing by
I don't get what's so wrong about that because I'm doing fine

So with my mind made up, I get up close, say what they like - laugh at their jokes
Now all you've got is the pictures of us, I know it's not enough

My thoughts are louder than the room that I'm in
They're growing wilder, why did I come here again?
Watching the light fade away into a gold hour
Sitting pretty like a Wallflower

Hanging with all my friends, they don't know where I've been
I show up and I'm there, and I sit but i don't fit in
Cause they'vе all known each other since way back whеn
And I'm always playing a game of catch up, I just can't win

If I take a chance on the world, it's gonna let me down

Why did you go away
Although i know it may never come true
I hope to see you some day
And i'll always remember
Those times that we shared
So if you're listening from up above, this is my prayer

You brought so much joy to this world of mine
Whenever i needed you came
A friend like you is so hard to find
Without you it won't be the same
And though many will try
No one can ever compare
So if you're listening from up above, this is my prayer

May the mountains rise to meet you
May the skies open wide
Know that in my heart, my friend
You will always be alive
There are so many things that i want you to know
So many words to say
And when he finally calls me home
I'll walk with you through those gates
So please remember me
Oh i promise i'll see you up there

Fully charged megabuster sauced for supper, scrumptious
Buddy, we cutting your set short with sword swing from Voorhees
Before you make the OGs go ""oh gees""
Please, ya'll the cream of the crop? More like the filling of zits
Gifted as shit
My lines Keanu's seen in green tint
Achoo (Bless you)
Why do he care when mucus airborne?
So fucked for dollars, caught wallet whacking off to Dare Dorm (okay)
I'm in rare form, got holographic skin
Don't care for thirsty bitches taking swigs of fella's styles

I'm taking swings with dusters dunked in lemon lime
Catch a Sprite from the most feisty white since Federline
Now your man's got boo-boo
Fist pressed that square's face in like Bandicoot's move
That cracker stays a modest emcee
Besides the braggadocio and getting swamped in pussy

And curse at my mistakes
And say I'm not what you think
I'll break all the links
I'll ignore all the exit signs

Cause you've had your own mountains to climb
And I've got skeletons I hide
In the back of my mind where I question myself
I dwell on the past just like everyone else
So bear the weight of the world on your shoulders, it's not too heavy
I'll break my back so you can feel like someone's on your side

Forget the past and all the heartache
The growing pains that keep you awake
I'll sing you to sleep with songs that let you know that we'll be okay
Round and round and round this goes
Playing on your stereo
When I'm away and you can't sleep
Just know that it's the same for me
[Verse 2]
And every time I see you I remember why I made you mine
That day in mid-December
Still so young and naïve with our hearts on our sleeves
But I know we'll be alright
They don't know what we share in the briefest of moments
I'm head over heels for the smallest components
That light in your eye or that look on your face
Secure in the fact that we both know our place

The perfect touch to the picture I had in my head
No one like you girl
Nowhere in the world that I would rather be

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't bear the weight of the world on your shoulders
It's not too heavy
Since we met it seems like we crossed paths at the right time

[Chorus]
Forget the past and all the heartache
The growing pains that keep you awake
I'll sing you to sleep with songs that let you know that we'll be okay
Round and round and round this goes
Playing on your stereo
When I'm away and you can't sleep
Just know that it's the same for me",703540,en,en,en

Steady stressin I can't wait

Barely hit any blizzys

All these relationships
I really can't debate the shit
Don't fuck wit liars
And chicks that always be faking shit
I know the people that love me
Really gon' bang this shit
I did this shit by my lonely
I really made this shit
Trippin' off no sleep
This shit done got to my head
I'm screaming free my nigga T
He in them chains wit the feds
Can't be swopping no numbers
If you ain't swopping no bread
Play at all wit my commas
And boy, I'm stretching your neck
Yeah
I remember them saying
They couldn't fuck wit me
I remember these bitches
Used to be ducking me
Got me a shawty
I promise mami gon' bust for me
Copped me a glizzy
And baby girl keep it tucked for me
All these niggas and bitches
Really got 2 faces
Fitted up wit the Nikes tough
Wit the new laces
I ain't talking
If you ain't speaking them blue faces
Hella clutch in the post
I really be flu gamin'
You too fugazzi
I honestly can not fuck wit that
Rolling that marley

Nobody want it; don't send it

You say you real but, you snitchin'
There ain't no trust for that

Ain't never sold my soul for some clout
And that be fashoo
These niggas pillow talking
But, they don't want any smoke
Got me a spanish mami
That's always gon' be on go
Hustlin' in my blood
I'mma always flip for the low
Do this shit for my city
And everyone showing love
I done kept it a bill
But, I run it up wit the dubs
Rappers acting like chicks
From the jump I knew you were sus
If you affiliated
On everything that's a plus
A nigga been out of bounds
Now It's time to get back to bidness
In the town I'mma legend
They really know who the sickest
I'm fully clipping and wit it
Don't try and get nothing twisted
I'm coming; no introduction
No busting, capping or cuffing

These niggas tryna to gut me

Believe,rap,Nikkotine,2016,18,{},"[Verse 1]
I believe that everyone should be treated equally
I believe in God even if he doesn't believe in me
I believe that everyone deserves to be treated with respect
And not to act like I'm something better 'cause I rap
I believe to show love and support to people and not to hate
I believe 'what goes around comes around' I believe in fate
So be careful what you do before you make any mistakes
I believe in hope even if it sometimes comes too late
I believe we're all the same no matter from where we're all equal
I believe in peace and freedom I believe in good people
All I'm saying is Give Peace A Chance, John Lennon, The Beatles
I believe one day I'll be free and be able to fly like an eagle
This is for the men that don't play and do everything they can
Work 8 hours a day just to support their fam
Mad respect to all moms at home raising their kids
On their own alone, homie, must be some crazy shit
I believe that Pac and Biggie are chillin' in paradise
With a bottle of Hennessy and a pair of dice

(Yeah homie, I believe in good people even if their hard to find
Real talk, nah mean)
[Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe (x8)

[Verse 2]
I don't believe in religions that claim to guide us
I don't believe in racism that the state creates to divide us
I don't wanna believe that people die 'cause the rich are too greedy
Driving Lamborghinis but can't give to the needy
'Cause you don't have enough? Let me ask you something funny
Dead presidents please tell me who created all this money?
And now tell me why do people still have to stay hungry?
Selling guns from the shelf do we can gang bang and shit
Throw our future away, hang at the corner store slangin' shit
'Til we get busted from the popo sent to jail
Doing you a favour 'cause you waiting for a G to fail
That's why I don't believe in the system fuck that shit
I don't believe in society y'all can suck my dick
It's Slick Nick and I'm ready to fight society fuck the law and fuck your propriety give me notoriety
I don't believe in church I don't believe in the State
I don't respect people who don't share what's on their plate
I don't respect people who think their better than others
But as soon as shit hits the fan they run back to their mothers
Talk behind your back but then they act like they're yo brothers
I don't respect people that are greedy and don't give
Don't wanna believe that some live to eat while others eat to live

Leading the way inside her habitat, with the butt of a gun I smash her dome
Doors now unlocked, I roll my van in the garage and use it as a loading dock

Harness sex swing, anticipating, loving soon hating
Cages rolled in, dogs awaken, the animal raping
Her limbs strapped down, her legs spread out, ball-gag in her mouth

Forced to appear inviting, the room smells of fish and shit
Hold down vomit while I fuck, soon the dogs will have her clit

Half hard while I blow my load, I can't even look at her - those rolls
Gather semen from her back, smeared her lips, nostrils, eyes, and hanging neck
Blood on my cock, pants left off, it's her time of the month
Natural scent begs for sex, in I bring the animal instinct

Release three pitbulls trained to her wet holes

Lover of animals, anything but herself
No wonder why, she's fine for fat swine
Scent of sweathog attracts mouth watering dogs
Bleeding fish clit hit with pink lipstick

I don't know why she's begging to stop, I'm just giving them the right to do what they want
They don't speak English, her painful groans sound like sexual moans

Tears of fear, their sense of smell she hears
Twat tasted before it's dog pasted

Animal lover, the feeling is mutual
Proving it to her by sliding it in her pooper

In they slide, holes occupied, animal fucking her like a hooker
They take turns in her rolls, to them she's a looker
Use a camera to film her being hammered, begin to jack off
I'm patient for their finish, until then they won't back off

Half hard while I gather my load, I can't even look at her - those rolls
Gathered semen from her back, smeared her lips, nostrils, eyes, and hanging neck
Blood on my cock, no pants on, it's her time of the month
Her natural scent begs for sex, they sniff the holes that accommodate pitbulls

She feels the first warm load

One-by-one each of the three blow puppy seed over random parts of her body
First one her side, second inside, the third pitbull still rides
She receives her K-9 creampie
On her lips she tastes the doggy paste, about to come I race to her face
Spray her face with human cream, I film the finish from POV
In their cages, lured with a treat, her deed to animals is complete
Before I go I clean off my cum, a victim of doggy love",5694670,en,en,en

Somebody move the goalposts out of line
Reason got no... ha
I can’t tell the time
Now it’s fight or flight
Danger ain’t arrived
I can’t tell what tense I’m in, but I know it’s heavy
Days fly by when I’m happy
But they go half-speed when I ain’t alright
And now I’m left and now I’m wrong

Like an eclipse living up in my mind
Bittersweet that I know what’s behind

But a knife need to be sharper

On my Bull shit, carry these chips
For a long time... for a long time

Every time that they counting me out
Take a left on this roundabout

Swimming in circles

Right beside you, you unaware
The light that guides you, but it’s hot air

A star will try to keep its brightness intact

Carry your smile but they drop acts
When your self-worth cannot pay them back
They assign you society’s rank
When you a king, yeah, they make you wear hats
Take your crown and remind you that
No, you ain’t nothing, but they subtract that
That’s the fact that
It’s hard to track back
You leave some breadcrumbs
But they’re just bait snacks
And you can’t trace jack

Black matter
The intangible substance in general
Of a physical being as embodying the mind and spirit to overcome group or individual oppression
(In physics) That which occupies no space or rest mass, but weighs heavily on both the enforcer and afflicted
Cannot be explained in single definition or confined to hearsay, but must be unapologetically felt
Viscerally

Man. I don’t know man, Handlez been tweakin folk
Man what you talm bout woadie
I mean. You know. His intros usually bout the punchlines and the wordplay, but... I mean it’s. It’s weird now bruh
I, I, I disagree bruh I mean he really talkin bout what matters (Yea. I hear you, I hear you) ya’nam sayin
And he really doin his thing out there. That yougin, you kno he really talkin bout what matters man
This what matters
This what matters

[Verse]
Look
Black matter, black matter
Been many bold movements, blacks matter
Big mansions big maneuvers, bad manners
Bent Mercedes Benz makes, black’s master
Big money broke motives
Black man been makin babies making baby mommas barely make it
Betrayal maybe, banking, major bucks making brothers malicious
Basically mother’s beautician, we gotta dye to see a difference
Feelin my shoulders holdin the weight of the soldiers fallin wade in the coldest water
Spur of the moment I’m Tony Parker runnin the point I’m guardin
Hold the gauntlet, warrior Trojan spartan, feelin like Morgan wanted
Tell em to go they on it hold up pardon load up...got em

Matter, definition I’ll state it, it reads as follows
An affair or situation that’s under consideration I’m askin
Do y’all even consider us in y’all nation I’m askin
Do you consider y’all president bein racist
See your silence..tells it all and your violence begets the violence
Unveil the lyin they tell us all trying to hide the obvious awe
Now y’all oblivious, tryin to deny our trials and all
They want to happen, just stick to rappin but nah
This another sound, it’s scary as thunder clouds
I’ll bury it underground like Harriet jumpin out
As my chariot hover round above various undertones that they sendin
Pull me over for tickets, am I comin home to my children but scratch
That see my people they love LeBron cause he black
But then they hate on Steph and Klay just for melanin that they lack and how’s that
Man I can’t front, that’s exactly what master wants
We got brothers from other sides of the tracks, laid on their backs
And honestly, my people probably not from Africa
But why does that matter bruh? that mean I’m not black as ya
Don’t see me as black enough
You see how that’s addin up
Believe it or not we could be more than magic but our own people attackin us
Deceitfulness actions trust other people are laughin crackin up
To keep us from stackin up, turn dream into ash n dust
Keep actin tough, slingin and squeezin a ratchet(buck)
It lead to a casket yup
And we couldn’t even imagine, see it or grasp it think it or fathom
We could amass a mass of leaders and masters ugh
Think I’m just rappin
Black matter, make normal bounce music look bowel movement
Black matter, when you think of beast mode I’m bout mutant
Been Malcolm boy my basic made bars mold big meaning
No Birdman been more bout me bein Martin than Big Meech
And been mentionin bold menaces before my first mixtape
But I ain't seen no difference, y’all just saw cold penmanship
But now ya souls listenin, I’m gon dig in it
Gold diggin cause our minds like mines with gold in it
Black matter, see this grey matter is dark matter, no words
Just my brain matter makes stars scatter
That’s exactly what we capable of
I’m here to bring it out you
Seize it and embrace wit a hug
I’m really bout this
Black matter, Shot the nose off our face to impair our souls
Black matter, so we can’t smell but still hear the Pharaoh moans
Black matter, stuck left to correct all the rights and wrongs
Black matter, I’m a king in my own...right or wrong

I lost faith in Jesus when I knew that I was living with Satan
So much emotional pain, that all I know now is hate and
Never experienced lovin’, so all I’ve got left is hatin’
Hopin’ my momma would change, But I’m still standin’ here waitin’
Don’t get me wrong, you know I got a lot of love for my mother
Parents divorced, so it was her alone with me and my brother
Working two jobs, in desperate need of a significant other
They never worked, so she was always on the search for another
When I’m in school, I always seem to be the classroom comedian
I’m either funny or sad, there’s never really a median
I’m with Adam and Eve in Eden, and apples we eatin’
We like to break the rules, because we’re disobedient deviants

My middle name’s Kurtis, I think it's common courtesy
For you to get to know me as I continue my story
I’m checkin’ my inventory, god dammit I’m out of glory
I’ll bury you in a quarry, while telling you that I’m sorry
When you’re determining who the best in the game would be
Take a look around and realize that it’s none other than me
I sit and wonder why I’m so weird and it’s probably
‘Cause I’m an anomaly that is commonly a rapping wannabe
Apology for my modesty, I’m an oddity
I’m constantly causing harm to me, seeking harmony
The prophecy tryna tell me that I’m a prodigy
But honestly I think I’m just better off doing comedy
This rap is helping me find myself like an odyssey
I’d probably do a better job if I studied psychology

Y’all are rapping ‘bout things you do not possess
Who you tryna impress? I can probably guess
I rap ‘bout my experiences and why I’m a mess
But I just wanna progress, and maybe be a success
There are things in need of address, I gotta get off my chest
The things I need to express, emotions that I repress
I had a fairly happy childhood, I gotta say
I’d never guess I’d grow to be the man I am today
But it just happened, my outlook on life just blackened
​As I progressively saddened, I’m nothing what I imagined
They say the happiest people are always the saddest
I’m definitely the maddest, you can tell by my Facebook status
There's a darker side to my mental, my life is so uneventful
Why am I so resentful, Why am I wasting potential?
I’ll be a doctor if laughter’s the best medicine

But if I leave her will she stop me?
Or will she let me go?

Is this a game, and am I just a playing piece?
If anything, just let me think
Cause she loves her man

These Fevered Days,rock,Marche Funbre,2013,11,"{""Marche Funèbre""}","Lava spat back for miles
Soil for my impermeable tomb
Urged to stray from the aisle
To erase me from this womb
But afar, lo, its crawling might
Crowns ignite green by light
Roots harbor life nor sound
Sunlight had never troubled the ground

Jukai, the sea is deep
My reasons for the woods to keep
I dive in, troubled with doubt
My vow is not to be found
As night falls, a flight of all hope
No longer designed to survive
The egress, dead or alive
Is by means of the rope

Won't you drag
These fevered days
Unto the sеa
And let them bleed
Under thе trees
These severed ways
Will leave their trail
Not to be found
In time
Elysium is as far as to
The very nearest room
If in that room a friend await
Felicity or doom

What fortitude the Soul contains
That it can so endure
The accent of a coming Foot
The opening of a Door

Doom is the house without the door
Tis entered from the sun
And then the ladder’s thrown away
Because escape is done

Three times dawn-to-dark
The forest seeps in my skin
The drought left its mark
My life is wearing thin
I contrive peers on my way
The letter, the rope, the bones
Descried nothing which atones
I saw dim light but no new day

Filled with thirst and hunger
I sink into endless slumber

A life swayed by regret
Lines from a tortured mind
For none will come to mourn
A rose with only its thorn",6541548,en,en,en

Let Go,rap,JL,2012,659,{},"[Verse 1: JL]
There have been many times, I thought about putting this mic down
And walking away from all of this and never looking back
Never making another track, get on some
Whole ’nother-other shit, try imagining that…
Always been the type of nigga to adapt
So what if I let it go, like fuck it, yo, it’s a wrap
Can’t get with all my energy anymore, this is wack
Did everything that I could, but I couldn’t get it to crack
Then I get to think about everything that I could’ve done
Differently, feel like yet an epiphany
Bro, you gotta be shitting me, I’ve wasted so much
What makes it so rough? I’m making no bust
Be patient, don’t rush, it’s making no sense
Got me so tense, my pocket’s so ?lit?
My mind is so spinned, find it appropriate to re-think
Regroup, read some, re-write, reboot
Then I get to think about what I wanted to do
If I could be anything but a rapper to you
Pack up, never get back in the booth
Find another path to pursue
Would I end up in a straight jacket up in a padded room?
Be up in the streets, acting a fool, packing a tool
Stabbing a few hoes, have ’em loving the crew…
Or what if I would’ve just went to school
Got a degree, never started smoking this weed
And writing melodies, succeed
Another way? What if I did it today?
Delete my FaceBook page and switch states
No mixtapes, no Twitter, just erase
Whatever I did place, consider the mistakes
I make, make new slates, a new page
Get married, have babies
New career, get rid of all of the maybe’s
Born in the 80’s, so hip hop raised me
But what if I went astray?
Followed another love like it was nothing to make
Something different instead of living up on the stage
Would you hate a nigga for wanting something to change?
Would you blame me?
Guess we’ll never know, ’cause I’m staying
Look what you made me, I’m not complaining
’cause the love that I’m getting is really amazing
So amazing, so amazing…

Wouldn't trade it for the world
W-wouldn't trade it for the world (x4)

Am I living a fairytale?
’Cause I’m beginning to get to know victory very well
I won’t let ’em get me, I’mma quickly parasail
I’m up in the air, none of y'all here
Got me thinking none of it spare
Not in front of me, you’re gonna be scared
You wanna be, but under me, and unaware
That I really be ripping it, they label without a care
You can sit and watch me, get up, pull up a chair
Everybody knowing I get in the zone
Cold, when I spit it, I’m on flow
Buy them all a bong, residue strong
Do the beat like an edible thong
I’m very credible, impeccable, the way I put on
And I’m a son of hip hop, I can never do wrong
And I’m where I belong, I believe and I’m ready, come on!
I’m goin' vertical, up, up, you stuck in a terminal
Tough luck, jock up the deuce and I turn into
A speck in the sky, you ain’t dealin' with a regular guy
Not on the regular high, no competitor is better than I
They get repetitive, when they say it a lot, thought you’re a hell of a lie
If you’re talking about otherwise

Living every moment like I’mma never be surprised
’cause any minute now, I know I’m gonna rise...

Its Lonely I Cant Stand,country,Charlie Major,1995,274,{},"I took the long way home tonight down a lonely road
No riders, no company, Just me and the radio
One by one I watched the miles slowly fall behind
My heart weighing heavy knowing what I wouldn't find

The moon over my shoulder and the stars up in the sky
There to remind me what's missing tonight

Chorus:
I don't mind being alone, it's lonely I can't stand
These empty nights ain't no life for a woman nor a man
It's been so long since I held or felt the touch of a loving hand
Being alone ain't so bad, it's lonely I can't stand

Staring out my window now at the world passing me by
Trapped here in this darkness doing solitary time
Accross the open fields I hear the soulful sad refrain
The high lonesome wailing of some distant midnight train

The sound of my heart beating and the silence in these rooms
They're to remind me what's missing tonight

It's just another night on the one hand
On the other, it cuts like a knife

Dangling high from tiny spools
Stretched tight like wires, but deep down in grooves
A puzzled frame without the glue
An earthquake sounds and shakes the room
The pieces fall, stay stuck by glass

Where the cold sleeps and the warmth moves
Where the cold sleeps and the warmth moves

The dunes part ways and skylines fall
Dirt and dust made of us all
Dirt and dust and devil's breath
Brought me to you, and us to death
Dirt and dust and devil's breath
Brought me to you and us to our debts

Where the cold sleeps and the warmth moves
Where the cold sleeps and the warmth moves

And there's no other way I'd want to live
Than on your heels through all of this
To watch the chaos pass on by
And to create as our own creation coincided
Leave those petty wars, and callous cries
For that little life we always needed
Where family trumps the nine-to-fives

WeednessBadness,rap,Gary The Cool Guy,2019,39,{BATTTS},"[Intro: Gary The Cool Guy]
I will now take it over to my n-word, Bat, the net

[Verse 1: Gary The Cool Guy]
Weedness equals badness
How did I come to this conclusion of madness?
It's simple
Weed kills an estimated total of six quadrillion people every year
That's the entire population of Italy, oh dear
So then why is it so easy to obtain?
Because the police do not see the pain
Of all the people who die in vain
They think they are cool for smoking weed
When in reality they just die instantly
With no warning
So as a message from Gary myself, do not smoke weed
Or else I will make you drink wee
Wee wee wee wee wee pee pee pee pee pee pee weed smoke kills
Did I tell you about the time that God smoked weed? He got so sick that he accidentally farted and created Australia
What a useless stupid country
Nothing happens there except people with stupid hats like to sit on the beach and do absolutely nothing
It's ridiculous
The effects of weed are far reaching and fatal
So don't smoke or die from wee facial
[Skit: Gary The Cool Guy]
I will now take it over to my n-word, Bat

[Verse 2: BATTTS]
I am searching for something cool
What is cool that I am searching for I don't know
Maybe it is something about a cool thing like a school
A school that makes many different pies grow
A pie from a pie tree
They all come from trees just believe me
So I left my house to go searching for the cool thing
And I walked into this cool old mule that would sing
Then he said ""Please go away""
And I said ""NO!""
So in return he proceeded to make me pay
He made a bump from my head grow
And that made me very, very sad
But it also made me very glad
I had remembered what I was looking for
But at the same time my head was very sore
I was looking for a cure for weed overdose
So all the amounts of death in the world would close
I walked up to the alter in the church
And what walked up to me was a man who said ""Ursch""
Which means absolutely nothing
But it ended the dumb thing
Of death caused by weed everywhere in the world
And justice to mourning families was then served",4295411,en,en,en

But I eat with a pen and pad, sleep with a pen and pad
Freak beats with a pen and pad, I put feel in the mind
Born ready able, willin' to rhyme, I'm a country chick still in her prime
And I'm bout tired of killin' the time
End everybody out there know, I'm ill with the lines
So when ridin', ridin', throw the top back
Venoms got a new CD in the store, go 'head and cop that
And all you DJ's, you gotta let the record spin
Matter fact, turn the volume up, set it ten

Been on, turn me up a little somethin' to watch me do the damn thing

Leave you fallen and can't get out the pothole

End Of Sorrow,pop,Autumn (Band),2011,70,{},"A new summer is secretly enchanting
All beings into a slumber
And wild flowers are blooming in abundance
With a vast amount of colour

I'll breathe and I'll be right at your doorstep
A flower bed will save me if I fall...

The cool shadow is stretching from the hillside
And sliding to the meadows
Where I'll follow under clouds of sparrows
My mind fixed on tomorrow
I foretell the end of sorrow

I breathe and I am right at your doorstep
Thoughts are drifting to another time
I dream we are the last couple dancing
Let me be the one to hold your hand
You'll see that I will hold on forever
Nothing can convince me otherwise
It's about as much as I can take
Beside the toughts that I can't shake
Return me to the life that came before this bitter end

Can't wait to mend our lives
Extend my time here by your side
Relieved and unashamed
Our eyes will find a new horizon

Yeah, start of this album bunch of year agos
Imagined my life full of miracles
Instead I get let down, continue losin’ hope
Instead I don’t show frowns, but I gotta dead soul
Yeah, violence has raised in my area
I attempt to change my ways for the best of her
Instead I get so dazed, I let go of love
Instead I don’t say what I should’ve

[Hook]
Girl you left, why you go left?
Should've never left left
You should've never left left

[Verse 1]
Damn, I think she left for the best
Is this feelin' worst than death?
I den sent so many text, she may be too stressed
Affection wasn't next, I should've held my own breath
I rushed into it, I'm a mess, since when do I get stressed?
Steppin' out on occasions, yellin' out loud cause i feel amazin'
It don't last long so Imma' take it, every last second
Bae why you get so vacant? Stressing out even on vacation
Distracted by danger, I don't feel so major

Girl you left, why you go left?
Should've never left left
You should've never left left

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my intros to my album influential
Every girl I get with i'm lookin' for my initials
Trent told me ""you'll only get bigger and better""
I stayed in last summer like outside was only winter
Yeah, enough of asking favors
Treated like i'm little, I'm only seeing the picture
I'm A 1, I touch down with my day ones
Fear nothin', words from no mistaken

[Hook]
Girl you left, why you go left?
Should've never left left
You should've never left left

[Verse 4]
Canceling out plans, heartbreak overwhelms
Why does love come to an end?
Do I even make sense?
Words get too dense, my meter hittin' 10
Anxiety begins, hurtin' from within
Violets to violence, don't you wanna see me win?
I'm losin' conscience, I hate that it's like this

Girl you left, why you go left?
Should've never left left
You should've never left left

Exchanging messages wit' icy
These females seem to follow me like homies and prices
Getting caught up nowadays losing my fightin'
Looking to devices, get my mind off it
2 months my license, excited a bit
I like when money comes if you tell me the width
I watch my own back no matter who i'm with
Seeker of my path since the genesis
No need for assist, life gets horrendous
I can only calm down and not seek out vengeance
Could it be better than this? Yeah, okay, yeah

Yeah, fuck all that guilt and sorrow
I'm focused up on the outcome
Creating slang's and motto's
I can't change or follow
I was built to bulldoze, then proceed wit' value
I'm solid, not hollow
My favors are so out of sight
Like it was hit by Carlos Carrasco
Family discussions, Collusion's and guy codes
My mentality colossal, possessions in a pothole
Don't dangle my worth, i'll let go in a hustle
I know my worth, exactly why i'm so subtle
Like a dark tunnel, like a muddle puddle
I'll sacrifice my cover
Everyone's goin' half, I'll make it double
16 or 22 songs, it's a hit wit' no scuffle
I'm Batman and Robin, aggressive and humble
When i'm put as a rival I sit back and chuckle
My come up's a puzzle
My come up's a struggle
Couldn't wear my shoes for a couple
Grinding gets real repetitive when there's a juggle
I'm dodging trouble
Like martin, not Russel
Maverick behavior, I keep it real when money's a wager
Constructing bangers, destroying like Frazier
When It comes to failure I'm a go getter
I settle for more, cause less is like later
I can't wait till later
Sustained play-maker

'Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers
See me feel the Tony Sopranos
As the panic attack us
I try to map it with the
Pen
When did I start to depend
On judgmental men and women
Who descend
From the weak and meek
Want to come for the family
Even my own flesh and blood
Have tried to handle me
By handing me
Deafening blows to my sanity
Like in year's time
They won't be grabbing my salary
How can it be?
Real love is so rare
I got friends who truthfully
Won't even dare to care
In my slumber
Parties I wonder if
Spinning this bottle of rum
Is just another
Coping mechanism
Like the jokes and lyricism
Hoping the prophecies of Monasticism
Are fulfilling
The self
Health, wealth and top shelf women ain't nothing
Unless my religion
Needs the Monk spitting
Twist and shouting
I hear my train a comin'
I'm throwing the towel in
To ride to Shaolin
Climb the mountain
To the apex
Sweating the tech of Rakim
Amen
Renounce my pursuits
I'm 'bout this spiritual
Living and kung-fu

Beginning with the beats
To the voice, flow, topics to hooks and rhyme schemes
And finally
In the bottom of the 35th

Tough tongue like an Atlantic columnist
So sharp I cut through anybody's lisp
And I don't want to trip
Fix my vision on the greatest of all time list
So timeless
I'll mime this
And still be sounding the flyest
Know a God MC has gotta stay pious
At peace
Until I'm released
Back into the hands of the beast
Out the Monastery
Straight back in the world
Back to these friends and back to these girls

Look me dead straight in the eyes and tell me you're not full of lies
Cast me out to sea again, this is where the end begins
Moving on, just send me prayers, just leave me now without a care
Just leave everything behind, I'll never get you off my mind

Mowed the lawn with ya whenever, bourbon was your liquor

Provided cream for your fam for years, retired

Took for granted the times you'd trip to NY on vacation
Thinkin' you'd be around for ever, probably neglected you
Unconsciously, the thought of me MCing made ya bug
Vividly at times imaging our last hug is bugged

Its hellos and long goodbyes

That's how you ended up in my bed
'Cause every new beginning come from some other beginning's end
So let's do it all again

[Verse 1]
Uh, when I think about you the madness it multiplies
If time is money I guess that time would be overpriced
We always fight, cursin' me out like it's poltergeist
Ten minutes later we makin' out and it's no surprise
You meditatin' in my livin' room, you so in line
You hate the way that I talk, you tell me I'm so Long Island
You're super fly without tryin', girl you're on auto pilot
But I can tell what you thinkin', I feel like Nostradamus
Oh my God, you're a goddess, I'll never break a promise to you
No, no matter, regardless, I'm always being honest with you
Even if it's impossible, I'ma Tom Cruise it
I ain't like them other dudes, are you stupid?
[Chorus]
When I think about all the time I wasted with you that make me mad, mad mad
I prolly shoulda known that I never get the approval of your dad, dad dad (shoulda known)
But I couldn't get you outta my head
That's how you ended up in my bed
'Cause every new beginning come from some other beginning's end
So let's do it all again

[Verse 2]
Uh, every day I'm with you, it's like the same story
I'm on my Groundhog shit, I feel like Bill Murray
I tell you all of my secrets like an informant
You straight from London, I'm so glad that you imported
I wanna see you in my bed, each and every mornin'
Even if you got a early meeting with your bosses
I'll go and make you coffee
Every girl that's in your posse's a 5'11'' Aussie
When you text me where you at
I come on over ASAP Rocky
Okay you got me, got me, I'm just so glad you want me
But other times I feel unqualified, you Donald Trump me
So what's I'm meant to do but write a song about it?
If it sells a million albums then I won't be mad about it, hoo

[Chorus]
When I think about all the time I wasted with you that make me mad, mad mad
I prolly shoulda known that I never get the approval of your dad, dad dad (shoulda known)
But I couldn't get you outta my head
That's how you ended up in my bed
'Cause every new beginning come from some other beginning's end
So let's do it all again
[Bridge]
I, I used to always be so mad, mad, mad
But now, I give up everything I had, had, had
Just to spend one more day with you
You really got me wantin' it bad
Oh, 'cause everything you do is like home
And now that you got me so, you got me so mad

[Chorus]
When I think about all the time I wasted with you that make me mad, mad mad
I prolly shoulda known that I never get the approval of your dad, dad dad (shoulda known)
But I couldn't get you outta my head
That's how you ended up in my bed
'Cause every new beginning come from some other beginning's end
So let's do it all again",3242584,en,en,en
For You,pop,PVSCALE,2020,11,{},"I'm calling for you
But you won’t answer

Smoking on cancer, hope I die faster
See your girl and I flew right past her
Preaching to the world now, I feel like a pastor
Feel like a gatekeeper, you don't know the password
I don't wanna hear these so called rappers
Moving so fast if that the world turns backwards
Dripping so hard like I came out the ocean
But I really just came from 206
I just put a pill inside my potion, now that’s what I call some emotion
Try to stop me but I just keep flowing
Like water my drip keep going
Always been a [?]
Running from myself 'cause I can't approach it
Trynna tell me that I'm soft spoken but I go hard every time I go in

I'm calling for you
But you won't answer
Everybody say it's on mе
I just think it's funny
Moving like a zombie
Don’t give mе my car keys
I said don’t give me my car keys
I might crash, I might crash
I'm off a flat
Clonazolam, I might crash, I might crash
It’s so bad, call me back

I'm calling for you
But you won't answer",6042371,en,en,en

I’m trying to play my clarinet, please go away
I’m so tired of having to deal with all you gays
You can call me Ricegum because I’M the supreme
I’ll kill you even harder than your already dead meme
I am Squidward Tennisballs, SHIT I MEAN TENTACLES
I’ll pour all my rage on you and cut off your testicles
Welcome to the Krusty Krab, I just wanna end it all
You better bend down when I lick your black balls

(0;33) Nigward:
Welcome to my hood, you stand no chance
Beating me when you can't have a stable romance?
Don’t face Nigward, I’ll leave ya’ face down in a ditch
Then I’ll get my boys, Spongedick and Patbitch
Shoot up Bikini Bottom and your fucking dick nose
Like my gun and your mouth, you really fuckin blow
It isn’t even a contest, you know I already won
I just ruined your life, call me Squilliam Fancyson

Don’t act so tough, you died in only a week
You’re on the equivalent of drinking fucking bleach
Everyone knows there can only be one
Fuck this, i’m blocking you and i’m done

You spit one more word and you’ll be thrown aside
You call yourself a threat? You commited suicide
One pop inside ya and you’ll cease to exist
